    question: "Will my treatment look natural or will people notice?",
    answer: "Natural-looking results are our signature. We follow the philosophy of 'enhanced, not changed' – you'll look like the best, most refreshed version of yourself. Our advanced techniques like the MD Codes™ method focus on restoring facial balance and harmony rather than creating an 'overdone' appearance. People will notice you look great, rested, and radiant.",

    question: "How long do results last and when will I see them?",
    answer: "Results vary by treatment type. Anti-wrinkle injections typically show results within 3-7 days, lasting 3-4 months initially. Dermal fillers show immediate results that continue improving over 2-4 weeks, lasting 6-18 months. PRP therapy results appear gradually over 3-6 months as collagen regenerates, lasting 12-18 months. We provide a personalized timeline during your consultation.",
