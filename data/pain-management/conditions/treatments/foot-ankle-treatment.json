Local anesthetic ensures comfort throughout. Procedure takes 30-45 minutes","preparation":"Stop anti-inflammatory medications one week before if safe. Stay well-hydrated. Bring supportive footwear—you'll walk out in them. For plantar fascia treatment, stretch your calf beforehand. Avoid barefoot walking for a week after. Come ready to follow a structured rehab plan—foot injuries need patience and persistence","followup":"Wear supportive footwear or a boot for 3-5 days. Apply ice for 15 minutes every few hours. Avoid high-impact activities for 2 weeks. Begin prescribed calf stretches and intrinsic foot strengthening at week 2. Gradual return to running/jumping under physiotherapy guidance. Most people return to desk work immediately, physical jobs after 3-5 days. Attend 8-week review to assess healing","outcome":"Over 4-8 weeks, that first-step morning pain in your heel fades away. Achilles stiffness improves. Ankle feels more stable. You can walk, run, hike, and stand all day without that nagging ache. The tissue is genuinely stronger and more resilient.
