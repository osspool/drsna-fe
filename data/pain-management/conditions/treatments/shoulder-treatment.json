Local anesthetic ensures comfort. The procedure takes 30-45 minutes and you'll receive a customized physio protocol before leaving",
"preparation":"Stop anti-inflammatory medications (ibuprofen, aspirin) one week before if safe. Avoid blood-thinning supplements. Wear loose-fitting clothing that allows easy shoulder access. Bring any recent MRI or ultrasound reports. Eat beforehand. Come ready for a sling for 24-48 hours post-procedure. Plan light activities only for 2-3 days after—no lifting or reaching overhead initially","followup":"Wear the provided sling for comfort for 24-48 hours but begin gentle pendulum exercises within 24 hours as instructed. Apply ice for 15 minutes every few hours on day one. Avoid lifting anything heavy for 2 weeks. Begin prescribed band exercises and scapular stabilization work at week 2-3. Progress to strengthening under physio guidance at week 4-6. Most people return to desk work within 2-3 days, manual work after 2 weeks. Attend your 6-week and 12-week reviews to assess range of motion, strength, and return to activity. Maintenance may include occasional booster injections","outcome":"Over 4-8 weeks, shoulder pain steadily improves as inflammation calms and tissue regenerates. Range of motion increases—you can lift arm overhead, reach behind back, and sleep on that side again without waking. Strength returns for lifting, throwing, and racquet sports. For frozen shoulder, mobility improves dramatically, often avoiding the 18-24 month natural recovery timeline. Many patients avoid surgery entirely. Results last 12-18 months. Rotator cuff tissue is genuinely stronger—not just symptom-masked","medicationRequired":"Local anesthetic injection at treatment site.
