        {
            "question": "Can knee injections help me avoid knee replacement?",
            "answer": "In many cases, yes. Regenerative treatments like PRP and Arthrosamid® can delay or avoid surgery by reducing pain, improving function, and supporting cartilage. Dr Abbas will assess your imaging and advise on realistic expectations."
        },
        {
            "question": "How long do knee injection results last?",
            "answer": "Results typically last 12-24 months depending on the treatment. PRP usually lasts 12-18 months, while Arthrosamid® can provide relief for 2+ years. Maintenance boosters help sustain long-term improvement."
        },
        {
            "question": "Does the knee injection hurt?",
            "answer": "We use local anaesthetic and optional nitrous oxide sedation for comfort. Most patients describe mild pressure rather than pain. The ultrasound guidance ensures precise placement with minimal discomfort."
        },
        {
            "question": "What's the difference between PRP and Arthrosamid®?",
            "answer": "PRP uses your own blood platelets to stimulate healing and regeneration. Arthrosamid® is a hydrogel cushion that integrates with your joint lining for long-lasting shock absorption. We recommend based on your imaging and symptoms."
        },
        {
            "question": "How soon can I exercise after knee treatment?",
            "answer": "Low-impact movement like walking is encouraged within 48 hours. Running and sports typically resume at 4-6 weeks depending on your progress and physio guidance."
        },
        {
            "question": "Can I combine injections with knee surgery?",
            "answer": "Yes. We support prehab before surgery to optimize outcomes, and biologics post-meniscectomy or arthroscopy to speed recovery and protect remaining cartilage."
        },
        {
            "question": "Is knee regenerative treatment covered by insurance?",
            "answer": "Some private health insurance policies cover regenerative knee treatments. We provide itemized invoices for reimbursement claims. Check with your provider about coverage for orthobiologics."
        },
        {
            "question": "How many knee injections will I need?",
            "answer": "Most protocols involve 1-3 injections over 4-6 weeks. Arthrosamid® is typically a single injection. PRP is usually a series of 3. Dr Abbas will design your specific treatment plan based on condition severity."
