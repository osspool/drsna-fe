{"faq":[{"question":"Can knee injections help me avoid knee replacement?","answer":"In many cases, yes. Regenerative treatments like PRP and Arthrosamid® can delay or avoid surgery by reducing pain, improving function, and supporting cartilage. Dr Abbas will assess your imaging and advise on realistic expectations."},{"question":"How long do knee injection results last?","answer":"Results typically last 12-24 months depending on the treatment. PRP usually lasts 12-18 months, while Arthrosamid® can provide relief for 2+ years. Maintenance boosters help sustain long-term improvement."},{"question":"Does the knee injection hurt?","answer":"We use local anaesthetic and optional nitrous oxide sedation for comfort. Most patients describe mild pressure rather than pain. The ultrasound guidance ensures precise placement with minimal discomfort."},{"question":"What's the difference between PRP and Arthrosamid®?","answer":"PRP uses your own blood platelets to stimulate healing and regeneration. Arthrosamid® is a hydrogel cushion that integrates with your joint lining for long-lasting shock absorption. We recommend based on your imaging and symptoms."},{"question":"How soon can I exercise after knee treatment?","answer":"Low-impact movement like walking is encouraged within 48 hours. Running and sports typically resume at 4-6 weeks depending on your progress and physio guidance."},{"question":"Can I combine injections with knee surgery?","answer":"Yes. We support prehab before surgery to optimize outcomes, and biologics post-meniscectomy or arthroscopy to speed recovery and protect remaining cartilage."},{"question":"Is knee regenerative treatment covered by insurance?","answer":"Some private health insurance policies cover regenerative knee treatments. We provide itemized invoices for reimbursement claims. Check with your provider about coverage for orthobiologics."},{"question":"How many knee injections will I need?","answer":"Most protocols involve 1-3 injections over 4-6 weeks. Arthrosamid® is typically a single injection. PRP is usually a series of 3. Dr Abbas will design your specific treatment plan based on condition severity."}],"hero":{"badge":"Ultrasound-guided precision","video":null,"headline":"Walk, Train, and Live Without Knee Pain","subheadline":"Doctor-led injections and rehab that cushion joints, calm inflammation, and strengthen support muscles.","image":"https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1508609349937-5ec4ae374ebf?w=1920&q=80"},"whatToExpect":{"enabled":true,"description":"","title":"What to Expect","background":"gradient-cream","steps":[{"number":1,"title":"Assessment & Imaging","duration":"45 mins","description":"Consultation, X-ray/MRI review, gait and strength testing."},{"title":"Regenerative Injection","number":2,"duration":"60 mins","description":"PRP, Arthrosamid®, or cellular therapy delivered under ultrasound guidance."},{"description":"Physio-prescribed loading plan, bracing, and anti-inflammatory nutrition.","duration":"Weekly check-ins","title":"Restorative Rehab","number":3},{"title":"Review & Maintain","number":4,"duration":"Week 8-12","description":"Follow-up imaging, booster planning, and return-to-sport timeline."}],"subtitle":"Predictable steps from assessment to pain-free movement","variant":"compact-timeline"},"description":"Ultrasound-guided PRP, Arthrosamid®, and cellular therapies that cushion arthritic knees and restore confident movement.","treatsAreas":{"title":"Conditions We Treat","subtitle":"Tailored protocols for each diagnosis","areas":[{"icon":"shield","image":"https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1544829099-b9a0c07afdba?w=800&q=80","description":"Arthrosamid® or PRP cushions cartilage and reduces swelling.","name":"Osteoarthritis (Grade 1-4)"},{"image":"https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1517398740160-2010e685ab73?w=800&q=80","icon":"patch-check","description":"BMAC or adipose therapy stimulates tissue repair alongside rehab.","name":"Meniscal & Cartilage Tears"},{"description":"High-density PRP targets tendon fibres to restore strength.","name":"Patellar Tendinopathy","image":"https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1508873696983-2dfd5898f08b?w=800&q=80","icon":"activity"}]},"testimonials":[{"age":58,"rating":5,"date":"2024-01-05","text":"Within eight weeks I could walk the Thames Path without swelling.
