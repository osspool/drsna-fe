Local anesthetic ensures comfort. Procedure takes 20-30 minutes","preparation":"Stop anti-inflammatory medications one week before. Arrive with clean hands—no creams or jewelry. Bring a splint if you have one (we can provide). Plan light duties for 48 hours after. For typists/musicians—arrange reduced workload for a few days. Come ready to commit to hand therapy exercises—these are crucial for lasting results","followup":"Wear provided splint for 5-7 days for support. Apply ice for 15 minutes every few hours on day one. Avoid heavy gripping, lifting, or repetitive hand movements for one week. Begin gentle range of motion exercises at day 3-5. Progress to strengthening under physiotherapy guidance at week 2-3. Most people return to desk work next day with splint support. Attend 6-week review to assess healing and adjust rehab","outcome":"Over 3-6 weeks, hand/wrist pain steadily improves. Grip strength returns. Stiffness reduces. You can type, lift, cook, play instruments, or work without that constant ache. Joints feel more stable and cushioned. Many patients avoid surgery entirely.
