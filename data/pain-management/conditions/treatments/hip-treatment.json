We advise 48 hours of reduced impact before returning to normal activity. Most patients are back to desk work same day.","question":"How soon can I bear weight after hip injection?"},{"answer":"Our aim is to delay or avoid hip replacement. Many patients successfully postpone surgery for years. Some still choose surgery later but with better strength and less pain, leading to better surgical outcomes.","question":"Can hip injections replace surgery?"},{"question":"How long do hip injection results last?","answer":"Results typically last 12-24 months depending on the treatment. PRP usually provides 12-18 months of relief, while BMAC can last 2+ years. Maintenance boosters help sustain long-term improvement."},{"question":"Does the hip injection hurt?","answer":"We use local anaesthetic to numb the area before injection. Most patients feel pressure rather than sharp pain. The ultrasound guidance ensures precise placement with minimal discomfort."},{"question":"How much does hip regenerative treatment cost?","answer":"The Hip PRP Series (3 injections + rehab) is £2,100. BMAC Cellular Reset is £3,450. Single injections start from £850. Consultation fee (£150) is credited toward treatment. 0% finance available."},{"question":"How many hip injections will I need?","answer":"Most protocols involve 1-3 injections spaced 4-6 weeks apart depending on condition severity. BMAC is typically a single injection, while PRP is usually a series of 3.

We provide itemized invoices for reimbursement claims. Check with your provider about coverage for orthobiologics."},{"question":"Can I still exercise with hip pain during treatment?","answer":"Yes, but we modify activity during the healing window. Low-impact exercise like swimming and cycling is often encouraged. High-impact activities resume at 4-6 weeks.

Concentrated healing cells from your own blood (PRP) or bone marrow (BMAC) are carefully injected where damage exists. The ultrasound lets us see exactly where the medicine goes—into the joint space, around torn tendons, or into bursa pockets. You'll feel pressure but not sharp pain. The whole process takes about 20 minutes","preparation":"Get MRI or X-rays done beforehand so we can plan precisely. Eat a good breakfast. Stop anti-inflammatory medications (ibuprofen, aspirin) one week prior if safe. Wear loose, comfortable trousers. Bring someone to drive you home. Come ready to rest your hip for 48 hours afterward—this is healing time, not injury time","followup":"Rest your hip for 48 hours—gentle walking only, no stairs or gym. Use ice packs and prescribed pain relief. Start the physiotherapy exercises we provide—they guide new tissue formation in the right direction. Avoid high-impact activities for 4-6 weeks. Attend follow-up at weeks 6 and 12 to track progress. Gradual return to running, cycling, or sports under physio guidance","outcome":"Hip pain gradually decreases over 6-12 weeks as new tissue forms. Grinding sensations smooth out. You can walk, climb stairs, and sleep on that side again. Stiffness improves. Many patients reduce or stop painkillers entirely. Results last 12-24 months.
