For PRP—your concentrated platelets are injected directly into the tear site to trigger healing. For micro-tenotomy (dry needling)—we use a fine needle to fenestrate (create tiny holes in) the degenerated tendon, breaking up scar tissue and stimulating fresh blood flow. Both techniques use local anesthetic and vibration distraction for comfort. The procedure takes 20-30 minutes","preparation":"Stop anti-inflammatory medications (ibuprofen, aspirin) one week before if safe to do so—they can interfere with healing. Stay hydrated. Eat beforehand. Wear loose sleeves for easy access to your arm. Come ready to rest your elbow for a few days after. Bring any recent imaging (MRI/ultrasound) if available","followup":"Rest your elbow for 48 hours—gentle movement okay, but no lifting or gripping. Apply ice for 15 minutes every few hours on day one. Wear the provided brace for support. Avoid anti-inflammatories for 2 weeks as they can slow healing. Begin eccentric strengthening exercises (we'll show you) at week 2-3. Gradually return to activities as pain allows. Attend 6-week review to assess progress","outcome":"Over 4-8 weeks, tendon pain steadily decreases as healthy tissue regenerates. Grip strength returns. You can lift, type, play racquet sports, or work out without that sharp elbow pain. Many patients achieve lasting relief that lasts 12-18 months. The tendon is genuinely stronger—not just symptom-masked","medicationRequired":"Local anesthetic injection at treatment site.
