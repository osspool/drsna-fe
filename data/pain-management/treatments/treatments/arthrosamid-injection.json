Consultant-led hydrogel treatment offering up to 3 years of relief for knee osteoarthritis.","schema":{"@type":"MedicalProcedure","procedureType":"NoninvasiveProcedure","bodyLocation":"Knee joint (intra-articular space)","howPerformed":"After numbing your knee with local anesthetic, a specialist uses live ultrasound imaging to guide a fine needle directly into the joint space. A smooth, gel-like substance (polyacrylamide hydrogel) is carefully injected. This special gel doesn't dissolve or wash away—it bonds with the soft lining inside your knee, creating a lasting cushion that protects worn cartilage. The whole procedure takes about 10 minutes","preparation":"Fast for 4 hours before (light fluids okay). Wear loose, comfortable trousers. Stop blood-thinning supplements one week prior if safe. Bring someone to drive you home. Your knee will be cleaned and draped in a sterile field. Relax—many patients say it's far less uncomfortable than they expected","followup":"Rest your knee for 48 hours—no weight training, running, or prolonged standing. Gentle walking around the house is fine. Use ice packs and prescribed pain relief. The gel needs 4-12 weeks to fully integrate and start cushioning effectively. Attend your week 12 follow-up for assessment. Gradually resume activities as pain allows, guided by physiotherapy","outcome":"Over 4-12 weeks, knee pain steadily decreases. The grinding, catching sensation improves. You can walk, climb stairs, and enjoy activities that hurt before. The cushioning effect lasts up to 3 years—far longer than steroid or hyaluronic acid injections. Many patients delay or avoid knee replacement surgery entirely. Your quality of life improves significantly","medicationRequired":"Local anesthetic injection to numb the knee. Optional oral sedative for anxious patients","medicalSpecialty":"Orthopedic Medicine","relevantSpecialty":"Regenerative Medicine","isProprietary":true,"treatmentFrequency":"Single injection provides relief for up to 3 years. Some patients choose a repeat injection after 2-3 years if symptoms gradually return.

Small bruise at injection site. Very rarely, infection (we use strict sterile technique) or allergic reaction to the gel","seriousAdverseOutcome":{"name":"Joint infection (septic arthritis)","probability":"Extremely rare (less than 0.1%) with proper sterile technique.
