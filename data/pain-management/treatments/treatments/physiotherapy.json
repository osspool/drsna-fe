Based on findings and any recent imaging or regenerative treatments (PRP, BMAC, adipose), your dedicated MSK physiotherapist designs a custom programme combining: (1) Manual therapy—hands-on techniques to release tight tissue, mobilize stiff joints, and restore alignment; (2) Progressive exercise prescription—starting with controlled movements to protect healing tissue, advancing to strengthening and functional loading; (3) Neuromuscular retraining—balance, proprioception, and movement pattern correction; (4) Education—sleep, ergonomics, nutrition, and stress management. You receive a digital exercise library with video demos, track progress in the app, and attend weekly or bi-weekly in-clinic sessions with your physio","preparation":"Wear comfortable, loose-fitting exercise clothing (shorts, t-shirt, trainers). Bring any recent imaging reports (MRI, X-ray, ultrasound) and a list of current medications or supplements. If you've had regenerative injections, note the dates and locations. Come ready to discuss your pain history, work demands, sports goals, and lifestyle. Prepare to commit to daily home exercises between sessions—consistency is everything","followup":"Complete your prescribed home exercise programme daily (typically 15-30 minutes). Log exercises and pain levels in the rehab app so your physio can adjust remotely. Attend scheduled in-clinic sessions (weekly initially, then bi-weekly). Report any flare-ups or setbacks immediately via app messaging. Progress reviews every 4-6 weeks include re-testing strength, range of motion, and functional tasks. As you improve, exercises progress from gentle mobility to loaded strength and sport-specific drills. Maintenance phase involves monthly check-ins and ongoing exercise adherence to prevent relapse","outcome":"Over 2-4 weeks, pain typically reduces as movement patterns improve and inflammation settles. Strength and range of motion increase progressively. You move with more confidence and less fear of injury. For post-injection patients, rehab locks in the healing gains—tissue remodels stronger and more resilient. Chronic pain sufferers regain function and reduce reliance on painkillers. Athletes return to sport safely. Results are sustained long-term when you maintain the exercise habits and movement strategies learned during therapy. Many patients transition to independent gym routines or maintenance check-ins quarterly","medicationRequired":"None—physiotherapy is drug-free","medicalSpecialty":"Physical Therapy","relevantSpecialty":"Sports Medicine","isProprietary":false,"treatmentFrequency":"Initial block of 6-12 weekly or bi-weekly sessions depending on condition severity.
