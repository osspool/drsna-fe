  "longDescription": "PRP harnesses the healing components inside your own blood—platelets, growth factors, and cytokines—and concentrates them up to 6x baseline. When injected precisely into damaged joints, tendons, or ligaments, PRP sparks collagen production, calms inflammation, and strengthens tissue. At Dr. SNA Clinic we use dual-spin centrifuges, ultrasound guidance, and tailored rehab so every drop delivers results.",

We draw a small amount of blood, process it in a dual-spin centrifuge to isolate a pure platelet layer, and inject it under ultrasound guidance into the damaged area. Growth factors trigger collagen synthesis, recruit stem cells, and increase blood flow so healing accelerates naturally.",
