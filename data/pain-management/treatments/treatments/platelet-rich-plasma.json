  "longDescription": "PRP concentrates the repair elements inside your own blood—platelets, cytokines, exosomes—and directs them to the tissues that keep holding you back. We draw a small vial, spin it twice to reach six-times baseline platelets, and guide the golden serum into painful joints or tendons under ultrasound. Pair it with physiotherapy and you have a drug-free, steroid-free plan that keeps you in the gym, on the pitch, or simply walking the school run without a limp.",

We draw a small amount of blood, process it in a dual-spin centrifuge, and inject the golden layer under ultrasound into the exact fibres that hurt.

      "howPerformed": "A small blood sample (about 2 tablespoons) is drawn from your arm—just like a routine blood test. This blood spins in our medical-grade centrifuge for 15 minutes, separating the golden platelet-rich layer from red blood cells. While you relax, we numb the treatment area. Using live ultrasound guidance, we inject the concentrated healing platelets precisely where damage exists. Your own growth factors immediately start repairing tissue",
      "preparation": "Eat a good breakfast—you need energy for healing. Stay hydrated for 2-3 days before. Stop anti-inflammatory medications (ibuprofen, aspirin) one week prior if safe to do so. Avoid fish oil and vitamin E supplements. Bring comfortable clothes. If treating a knee or hip, wear loose trousers. Your body does the healing—we just concentrate it",
      "followup": "Rest the treated area for 48 hours—no heavy lifting or intense exercise. Gentle walking is encouraged. Use ice packs if there's swelling. Skip anti-inflammatories for 2 weeks as they can interfere with healing. Follow the prescribed physiotherapy exercises to guide new tissue formation. Most people return to desk work immediately, physical jobs after 2-3 days",
      "outcome": "Over 3-12 weeks, damaged tissue gradually rebuilds. Pain decreases as inflammation calms. Joints feel smoother and more stable. Tendons regain strength and flexibility. Many patients reduce or eliminate pain medications. The healing is real and lasting—not just symptom masking. Results typically last 12-18 months, and you can repeat treatment to maintain gains",

      "question": "Does PRP injection hurt?",
      "answer": "We use local anaesthetic, vibration therapy, and nitrous oxide if needed. Most patients feel only mild pressure during the ultrasound-guided injection. The blood draw is like a routine test."
    },
    {
      "question": "How soon can I exercise after PRP?",
      "answer": "Gentle movement starts immediately. Walking is encouraged. Higher impact activities or heavy lifting resume after physio clearance, typically at 2-4 weeks depending on the treated area."
    },
    {
      "question": "How long do PRP results last?",
      "answer": "Results typically last 12-18 months. Many patients experience longer relief with proper rehabilitation. Maintenance injections can be scheduled annually to preserve joint health."
    },
    {
      "question": "How many PRP injections will I need?",
      "answer": "Most patients see significant improvement after 1-3 injections spaced 4-6 weeks apart. Severity of the condition determines the exact protocol. Dr Abbas will create your personalized treatment plan."
    },
    {
      "question": "Is PRP better than cortisone injections?",
      "answer": "PRP addresses the root cause by regenerating tissue, while cortisone only reduces inflammation temporarily. PRP has no steroid side effects and provides longer-lasting results. Many patients transition from cortisone to PRP for sustainable relief."
    },
    {
      "question": "Can PRP help avoid knee replacement surgery?",
      "answer": "In many cases, yes. PRP can regenerate cartilage and reduce inflammation enough to delay or avoid surgery. Dr Abbas will assess your imaging and advise whether you're a suitable candidate."
    },
    {
      "question": "Is PRP covered by insurance?",
      "answer": "Some private health insurance policies cover PRP therapy. We provide itemized invoices for reimbursement claims. Check with your provider about regenerative medicine coverage."
    },
    {
      "question": "Can PRP be combined with other treatments?",
      "answer": "Yes, we often combine PRP with shockwave therapy, physiotherapy, or cellular injections (BMAC, adipose) for layered results. Combination protocols often achieve faster and more complete recovery."
