    {
      "answer": "We use local anaesthetic and offer conscious sedation. Most patients report mild soreness at the harvest site for 24-48 hours, easily managed with paracetamol. The injection site feels similar to a standard joint injection.",
      "question": "Is the BMAC harvest painful?"
    },
    {
      "question": "How soon will I notice improvement after BMAC?",
      "answer": "Expect gradual improvement from 6-12 weeks as stem cells regenerate tissue and inflammation subsides. Most patients report significant pain reduction by 3 months, with continued improvement up to 12 months."
    },
    {
      "question": "How long do BMAC results last?",
      "answer": "Clinical studies show BMAC results can last 3-5 years or longer. Many patients avoid joint replacement surgery entirely. Annual follow-ups help monitor progress and determine if boosters would benefit you."
    },
    {
      "question": "Is BMAC better than PRP for joints?",
      "answer": "BMAC contains stem cells and is more potent than PRP, making it ideal for severe arthritis and large tendon tears. PRP works well for mild-moderate conditions. Dr Abbas will recommend based on your imaging and condition severity."
    },
    {
      "question": "How much does BMAC therapy cost?",
      "answer": "BMAC therapy starts from £3,450 including harvest, processing, injection, and rehab plan. The BMAC + PRP Boost package is £3,950. Consultation fee (£200) is credited toward treatment. 0% finance available."
    },
    {
      "question": "Can BMAC help me avoid knee replacement surgery?",
      "answer": "In many cases, yes. BMAC can regenerate cartilage and significantly reduce pain, delaying or avoiding joint replacement. Success depends on arthritis severity—we'll review your imaging and give honest expectations at consultation."
    },
    {
      "question": "Is BMAC covered by insurance?",
      "answer": "Some private health insurers cover BMAC therapy as an orthobiologic treatment. We provide detailed invoices and medical reports to support your claim. Check with your provider about regenerative medicine coverage."
    },
    {
      "question": "What's the recovery time after BMAC?",
      "answer": "Rest for 72 hours post-procedure, then begin guided physiotherapy. Most patients return to desk work within 3-5 days. Progressive loading starts at week 2, with return to sport typically at 10-12 weeks depending on your condition."
