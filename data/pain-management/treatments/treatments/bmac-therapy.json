    "title": "Why Choose BMAC?",
    "content": "Bone marrow contains mesenchymal stem cells, growth factors, and cytokines that promote deep tissue regeneration. BMAC is ideal when PRP or adipose therapy isn’t strong enough. We aspirate bone marrow from the iliac crest, concentrate it using lab-grade centrifuges, and inject it under ultrasound or fluoroscopy into joints, tendons, or discs.",
