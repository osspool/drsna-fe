  "faq": [
    {
      "question": "Will the bone marrow harvest hurt?",
      "answer": "We numb the hip with local anaesthetic and offer twilight sedation. Most people describe gentle pressure for 2–3 minutes and only mild bruising for 24–48 hours, managed with paracetamol."
    },
    {
      "question": "When should I expect to feel different?",
      "answer": "Inflammation calms first at 4–6 weeks. True strength and freedom arrive around the 12-week review when collagen and cartilage have had time to remodel."
    },
    {
      "question": "How long can BMAC results last?",
      "answer": "Published studies show 3–5 years of relief, with some knees holding strong for even longer. Annual reviews keep you on top of maintenance boosters."
    },
    {
      "question": "Can BMAC delay a knee or hip replacement?",
      "answer": "Yes—if you still have some cartilage left, BMAC can stabilise the joint, reduce pain scores, and buy meaningful time before surgery. Dr Abbas will be honest if replacement is the safer option."
    },
    {
      "question": "Do I need PRP or Arthrosamid as well?",
      "answer": "Severe joints often benefit from layered care. We frequently pair BMAC with Arthrosamid for cushioning or with high-yield PRP boosters to keep the biologic signal active."
    },
    {
      "question": "What does aftercare involve?",
      "answer": "72-hour rest, anti-inflammatory nutrition, compression, then guided physiotherapy starting at week two. Desk work resumes within 3–5 days; sport clearance happens after strength testing."
    },
    {
      "question": "Is finance or insurance available?",
      "answer": "0% finance plans are available, and we provide detailed medical reports for private insurance submissions where orthobiologics are covered."
