  "description": "Mini-liposuction harvests your own stem cells, we concentrate them in our lab, and Dr Abbas guides them back into the joints and tendons that refuse to heal.",
  "longDescription": "Stem cell therapy is the London answer for people stuck between painkillers and surgery. We gently harvest adipose tissue from the abdomen or flanks, isolate millions of mesenchymal stem cells—100x more than bone marrow—and reinfuse them into arthritic joints or stubborn tendon tears under ultrasound guidance. Each protocol includes lab testing, sedation, and a personalised rehab plan so the renewed tissue actually learns how to move again.",

    "content": "Fat tissue is a rich, gentle source of mesenchymal stem cells. When we reinfuse these cells into a degenerative joint, they orchestrate repair: calming cytokines, building new collagen, and recruiting your own healing cells. It’s ideal for moderate arthritis, labral tears, tendinopathy, and chronic inflammation when PRP is no longer enough.",
