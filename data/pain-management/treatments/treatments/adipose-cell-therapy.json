Injected into painful joints, it reduces inflammation, improves lubrication, and protects cartilage for sustained relief. It’s ideal for patients who want a potent, natural alternative before considering surgery.",

    "title": "Why Adipose Cells Work",
    "content": "Adipose tissue is rich in mesenchymal stem cells, growth factors, and cushioning matrix. We harvest a small amount via mini-liposuction, process it in a closed system to preserve cell integrity, and reinject it into joints or tendons under ultrasound guidance. The cells modulate inflammation, improve lubrication, and stimulate repair for long-term relief.",
