The whole process takes 90 minutes","preparation":"Fast for 4 hours before (clear fluids okay). Stop blood-thinning medications one week prior if safe. Bring loose, comfortable clothing. Someone must drive you home if sedation is used. Complete any required imaging (MRI/X-ray) beforehand. Eat well in days leading up—healthy fat makes healthier cells. Come ready for significant, long-lasting relief","followup":"Rest treated joint for 48-72 hours—gentle walking okay, but no high-impact activities. Use ice packs and prescribed pain relief. Small liposuction site needs simple dressing changes. Avoid anti-inflammatories for 2 weeks as they interfere with healing. Follow prescribed physiotherapy protocol to guide new tissue formation. Most people return to desk work in 2-3 days, physical activities after 2 weeks","outcome":"Over 6-12 weeks, joint pain steadily decreases as inflammation calms and tissue regenerates. Joints feel more cushioned and stable. Mobility improves. Many patients significantly reduce or eliminate pain medications. The stem cells and growth factors create lasting repair—not just symptom masking. Results typically last 24+ months.
