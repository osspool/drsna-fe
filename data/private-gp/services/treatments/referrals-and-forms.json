For new patients, a medical assessment is necessary to verify facts before documentation. For existing patients, we review your medical records. Dr. Abbas then personally prepares the document on official headed paper with GMC registration details, ensuring all required information is accurate and comprehensive. For specialist referrals, we may contact the consultant directly to discuss your case and ensure appropriate onward care. For visa or embassy documentation, we follow specific country requirements precisely. All documents include relevant medical history, examination findings, test results, diagnoses, treatment plans, and prognoses as required.
