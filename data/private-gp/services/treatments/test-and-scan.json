First, you'll have a consultation (in-person, video, or phone) with Dr. Abbas to determine which tests are appropriate for your symptoms or health concerns. For blood tests, our experienced phlebotomist collects samples on-site in our comfortable clinic using sterile, single-use equipment—most blood draws take 5-10 minutes. Samples are sent to our partner UKAS-accredited laboratories with priority processing. For imaging (ultrasound, X-ray, MRI, CT, DEXA, echocardiogram), we book you at our trusted partner imaging centers across central London—often with same-day or next-day appointments. You receive clear preparation instructions (fasting, medication adjustments, contrast information). All results are reviewed personally by Dr. Abbas who interprets findings in the context of your symptoms and medical history, provides clear explanations, and recommends next steps—whether reassurance, treatment, lifestyle changes, or specialist referral. Results and action plans are shared via secure digital portal and follow-up call","preparation":"For blood tests: fast if required (usually 10-12 hours for lipid or glucose tests). Stay well-hydrated. Bring list of medications. For imaging: follow specific preparation instructions provided (may include fasting, bowel prep, avoiding metal, contrast consent forms). Arrive on time to avoid delays. Bring any previous imaging or test results for comparison. Come with questions written down. For sexual health screening, note dates of potential exposure","followup":"Most blood test results available within 24-72 hours. Imaging reports typically within 3-5 working days (urgent cases expedited). Dr. Abbas reviews all results and contacts you with clear interpretation and recommendations. Follow-up consultation arranged if abnormalities found or further investigation needed. All results stored securely in your digital health record. We liaise with specialists for onward referral if required. Repeat testing arranged if monitoring trends. We can share results with your NHS GP with your consent","outcome":"Gain definitive answers about your health concerns through objective testing. Early detection of conditions allows for prompt treatment and better outcomes. Rule out serious pathology for peace of mind. Monitor chronic conditions effectively with regular testing. Track biomarkers to measure treatment effectiveness. Rapid access (often same-day) means no anxious waiting. GP interpretation ensures you understand what results mean for YOUR health, not just numbers on a page.
