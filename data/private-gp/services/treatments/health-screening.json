Dr. Abbas begins with an in-depth consultation covering your medical history, family history, lifestyle, diet, stress levels, sleep quality, and health goals. This is followed by a full physical examination including cardiovascular assessment, respiratory function, abdominal palpation, and screening for common conditions. Our experienced phlebotomist then takes blood samples for a comprehensive panel of 40+ biomarkers including full blood count, liver and kidney function, lipid profile (cholesterol, triglycerides, HDL, LDL), HbA1c (diabetes), thyroid function (TSH, T3, T4), vitamin D, B12, folate, iron studies, testosterone (for men), hormones (for women), inflammatory markers (CRP), and optional cancer markers (PSA, CA125). Additional tests include 12-lead ECG to assess heart rhythm and electrical activity, spirometry for lung function, urinalysis, blood pressure monitoring, BMI and body composition analysis, and optional add-ons like DEXA bone density scan, cardiac CT calcium scoring, or whole-body MRI. All results are reviewed personally by Dr. Abbas who provides a detailed interpretation, risk assessment, and personalized action plan","preparation":"Fast for 10-12 hours before your appointment (water okay, no food or drinks with calories). Take regular medications unless advised otherwise. Avoid intense exercise for 24 hours before. Bring a list of current medications, supplements, and family medical history. Wear comfortable, loose clothing for examination. Arrive well-rested. Book your screening for a morning slot when fasting is easier. If adding imaging, we'll provide specific preparation instructions","followup":"Receive your comprehensive digital report within 48-72 hours containing all test results with reference ranges and Dr. Abbas's detailed commentary. A follow-up consultation (video or in-person) is scheduled to review findings, discuss any abnormalities, and create your personalized wellness roadmap. This includes nutritional recommendations, exercise prescription, supplement protocols, stress management strategies, and any referrals to specialists if concerning findings arise. Lifestyle coaching and accountability check-ins available. Annual or biannual repeat screenings recommended to track trends and catch changes early","outcome":"Gain complete clarity about your current health status and risk factors for future disease. Identify hidden problems before they cause symptoms—early detection of prediabetes, high cholesterol, thyroid dysfunction, vitamin deficiencies, hormonal imbalances, or cardiac risk factors allows for intervention before serious complications develop. Receive a personalized roadmap to optimize health, longevity, and performance. Peace of mind from knowing you've been thoroughly assessed by an experienced physician. Tracking biomarkers year-on-year allows you to measure progress and catch subtle changes. Executive clients report improved energy, focus, and productivity after addressing deficiencies and optimizing lifestyle.
