We don't rush—appointments are 30-45 minutes. If diagnostic tests are needed (throat swab, urine dip, rapid COVID/flu, blood tests), these are arranged immediately either on-site or with priority laboratory booking. You receive a clear diagnosis and treatment plan which may include private prescriptions issued on the spot, injectable therapies, sick notes for work, advice for home care, or referrals to trusted specialists if escalation is needed. All findings are documented in your secure medical record. You'll receive a follow-up call or message within 48 hours to check progress","preparation":"Bring a list of current medications, supplements, and any allergies. If you have recent test results or medical letters, bring these. Write down your symptoms with timeline and triggers. For suspected infections, note when symptoms started and any self-medication tried. Come ready to discuss your full medical history. If booking a home visit, ensure someone is present to let the doctor in. For video consultations, test your camera and microphone beforehand","followup":"Follow all treatment advice and medication instructions carefully. Complete any prescribed antibiotic courses fully. If symptoms worsen or new symptoms develop, contact the clinic immediately—we prioritize existing patients. Attend any arranged follow-up appointments or tests.
