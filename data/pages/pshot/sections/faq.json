  {
    "question": "Will it hurt?",
    "answer": "Honestly? No. We use a strong numbing cream, and most men say they barely feel anything. It's far less uncomfortable than you're imagining."
  },
  {
    "question": "When will I notice a difference?",
    "answer": "Most men feel something within 2-4 weeks. The full results — that's when you really notice it — come around 6-12 weeks as your body regenerates new tissue."
  },
  {
    "question": "How long will results last?",
    "answer": "12-18 months typically. Some men go longer. Many choose to do a maintenance treatment once a year to keep results strong."
  },
  {
    "question": "I've tried pills. Will this actually work for ED?",
    "answer": "The P-Shot works differently — it addresses the root cause by improving blood flow and regenerating tissue. Studies show 70-80% improvement in erectile function. It's not a quick fix; it's a real solution."
  },
  {
    "question": "What kind of size increase is realistic?",
    "answer": "10-20% increase in both length and girth. That's what the research shows, and that's what our patients experience. It's noticeable."
  },
  {
    "question": "Will I need to take time off work?",
    "answer": "No. You walk in, we do the treatment, you walk out. Resume normal activities immediately. We just ask you to wait 24-48 hours before intimate activity."
  },
  {
    "question": "How do I know if this is right for me?",
    "answer": "Book a consultation. It's confidential, no-pressure, and free. Dr Abbas will assess your situation and tell you honestly whether P-Shot — or something else — is the right path."
  },
  {
    "question": "Is this actually safe?",
    "answer": "Very. We're using your own blood, so there's no risk of rejection or allergic reaction. It's been used safely in over 500,000 procedures worldwide."
