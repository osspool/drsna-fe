      question: "Will it hurt?",
      answer: "Honestly? No. We use a strong numbing cream, and most men say they barely feel anything. It's far less uncomfortable than you're imagining.",
    },
    {
      question: "When will I notice a difference?",
      answer: "Most men feel something within 2-4 weeks. The full results — that's when you really notice it — come around 6-12 weeks as your body regenerates new tissue.",
    },
    {
      question: "How long will results last?",
      answer: "12-18 months typically. Some men go longer. Many choose to do a maintenance treatment once a year to keep results strong.",
    },
    {
      question: "I've tried pills. Will this actually work for ED?",
      answer: "The P-Shot works differently — it addresses the root cause by improving blood flow and regenerating tissue. Studies show 70-80% improvement in erectile function. It's not a quick fix; it's a real solution.",
    },
    {
      question: "What kind of size increase is realistic?",
      answer: "10-20% increase in both length and girth. That's what the research shows, and that's what our patients experience. It's noticeable.",
    },
    {
      question: "Will I need to take time off work?",
      answer: "No. You walk in, we do the treatment, you walk out. Resume normal activities immediately. We just ask you to wait 24-48 hours before intimate activity.",
    },
    {
      question: "How do I know if this is right for me?",
      answer: "Book a consultation. It's confidential, no-pressure, and free. Dr Abbas will assess your situation and tell you honestly whether P-Shot — or something else — is the right path.",
    },
    {
      question: "Is this actually safe?",
      answer: "Very. We're using your own blood, so there's no risk of rejection or allergic reaction. It's been used safely in over 500,000 procedures worldwide.",
