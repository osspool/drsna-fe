      "Many have tried treatments that offered brief relief but didn't solve the real problem, or felt rushed and unheard in other clinics. What they want is human and understandable: to feel like themselves again, to move with comfort, and to sit in front of a doctor who truly understands.",
      "Dr Abbas does more than diagnose. He listens deeply, explains clearly, and approaches every concern with precision and compassion. His purpose is to help you feel lighter, more confident, and reconnect with the version of yourself you have missed."
