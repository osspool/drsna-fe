Run a longevity panel (lipids, HbA1c, inflammatory markers) plus nutrigenomic testing if possible. Compare your lifestyle habits to FOXO3/MC1R guidance and note quick wins like antioxidant intake or UV exposure.

## Daily longevity stack
- **Morning:** sunlight exposure, hydration with electrolytes, protein-rich breakfast
- **Midday:** resistance training or Pilates + fascia release
- **Evening:** blue-light curfew, magnesium glycinate, journaling to downshift cortisol

Sleep and glycation control keep collagen pliable—protect them ruthlessly.

## Regenerative accelerators
After dialling lifestyle basics, add:

1. **PRP facelift** to reset luminosity and pore texture.
2. **Polynucleotide boosters** for hydration and barrier repair.
3. **Stem cell or exosome infusions** when joint or skin damage needs deeper rebuilding.
