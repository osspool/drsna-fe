Schedule three ten-minute rituals weekly: phone-free walks, shared gratitude audio notes, or breathwork. These lower cortisol and make nervous system responses more predictable during intimacy.

### Conversation framework
Ask each other:
- What felt connecting this week?
- What do you need more of?
- How can I help today?

Consistency matters more than eloquence—stay curious, not critical.

## Support circulation & hormones
Track sleep, alcohol, and training in a shared note. Aim for 7.5 hours of sleep, <7 units of alcohol, and resistance training twice weekly. Add pelvic floor physiotherapy or EMSella if you notice leaks or poor arousal.

## Medical pathways
Once foundations settle, stack regenerative options:

1. **P-Shot®** for penile tissue quality (men) or O-Shot® for feminine arousal.
2. **Shockwave therapy** to rebuild vascular networks without pills.
3. **Hormonal & peptide support** (testosterone optimization, BHRT, kisspeptin, PT-141) coordinated with labs.

Document every session in a shared tracker so behavioural and medical wins stay visible.`;
