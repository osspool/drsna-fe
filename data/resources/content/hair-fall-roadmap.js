const content = `## Understand your shedding windows
Keep a two-week shed diary noting how many strands you lose on pillowcases, in the shower drain, and while brushing. Sudden spikes help us spot telogen effluvium versus gradual androgenic thinning.

### Labs to screenshot
- Ferritin, serum iron, transferrin saturation
- Thyroid panel (TSH, FT3/FT4)
- B12, folate, vitamin D
- High-sensitivity CRP + fasting insulin

Bring the lab PDF to your consultation so we can plot them against symptom timelines.

## Build a 12-week at-home plan
Layer scalp nutrition (microneedling + peptide serums), inflammation control (ketoconazole shampoo + red light) and stress rituals. Document weekly photos using the same lighting so micro wins are obvious.

> Pro tip: book a quick check-in at week 6 even if you're not ready for injections. Adjusting supplements early prevents wasted months.

## When to escalate to clinic care
If you're still shedding heavily after 12 weeks or seeing widening parts, it's time to add regenerative medicine:

1. **Dual-spin PRP** for early thinning or postpartum recovery.
2. **Exosome boosters** when density goals stall.
3. **Regenera® micro-grafts** for receding temples or scars.

Pair treatments with maintenance LED and lifestyle tweaks to lock in regrowth.`;
