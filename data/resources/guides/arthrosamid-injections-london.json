  "subtitle": "Advanced hydrogel technology that replaces lost cushioning in arthritic knees—delivering lasting relief without pills, steroids, or joint replacement.",
  "summary": "Arthrosamid is a non-biodegradable polyacrylamide hydrogel (iPAAG) that integrates into your knee joint to restore shock absorption and reduce pain. Unlike hyaluronic acid (lasts 6 months) or steroids (temporary relief), Arthrosamid provides 3+ years of documented improvement. One injection. One afternoon. Life-changing results.",

      "Surgery feels too extreme. Pills mask pain but don't fix anything. Steroid injections wear off in weeks. You're stuck in limbo between 'manageable discomfort' and 'life-altering surgery.' That's where Arthrosamid changes the equation.",

This guide explains the science, walks through the London treatment process, and helps you decide if Arthrosamid is right for you."

Unlike hyaluronic acid (which your body breaks down in 6-12 months), Arthrosamid doesn't degrade. It integrates into the synovial membrane lining your joint and stays there, permanently restoring the cushioning your knee has lost."

Arthrosamid injects into this space, physically increasing joint cushioning. The hydrogel swells to fill gaps, reducing friction during movement. Your knee essentially gets new suspension. Pain drops. Range of motion improves. Weight-bearing becomes tolerable again."

  "faqs": [
    {
      "question": "How is Arthrosamid different from gel injections I've had before?",
      "answer": "You've likely had hyaluronic acid (Synvisc, Ostenil, Durolane). That's temporary viscosupplementation—your body absorbs it in 6-12 months. Arthrosamid is non-biodegradable hydrogel that stays in your joint permanently, integrating into tissue. It's a fundamentally different material and mechanism, which is why it lasts years, not months."
    },
    {
      "question": "Does the injection hurt?",
      "answer": "Comparable to any knee injection—brief needle stick, pressure sensation as gel enters joint, mild discomfort. We use local anesthetic. Most patients rate pain as 3-4/10 for 5-10 seconds during injection. Post-procedure soreness (like a bruise) lasts 24-48 hours. Far less painful than surgery, far more tolerable than chronic knee pain."
    },
    {
      "question": "How quickly will I notice improvement?",
      "answer": "Timeline: Week 1 (swelling settles), Week 2 (first pain reduction), Weeks 4-6 (significant mobility gains), Weeks 8-12 (near-maximal benefit). Some patients notice immediate relief as the gel cushions bone-on-bone grinding. Others take 6-8 weeks as inflammation calms and hydrogel fully integrates. Patience is key."
    },
    {
      "question": "Will I need repeat injections?",
      "answer": "No. Arthrosamid is designed as a single-treatment solution. Clinical trial data shows sustained benefit through 156 weeks (3 years) without retreatment. Some patients report ongoing improvement beyond trial endpoints (5+ years). If pain returns, it's usually disease progression requiring re-assessment—not Arthrosamid failure requiring re-injection."
    },
    {
      "question": "Can Arthrosamid delay or prevent knee replacement?",
      "answer": "Possibly. Many orthopedic surgeons use Arthrosamid to 'buy time' for patients not yet ready for replacement—whether due to age, activity level, or personal preference. If it delivers 3-5 years of acceptable function, that's 3-5 more years of your natural knee. No guarantee it prevents surgery, but it's a reasonable interim strategy."
    },
    {
      "question": "What are the risks and side effects?",
      "answer": "Common: temporary swelling (15-20% of patients, resolves in 2-5 days), mild pain at injection site, stiffness for 24-48 hours. Rare: infection (<1%, same as any injection), allergic reaction (extremely rare—polyacrylamide is biocompatible), no improvement (20-30% non-responders). Serious complications are exceptionally rare in published literature."
    },
    {
      "question": "Can I combine Arthrosamid with other treatments?",
      "answer": "Yes. Common combinations: PRP injections 3-6 months post-Arthrosamid (boosting tissue repair), physiotherapy focusing on quadriceps strengthening (essential for knee stability), weight management programs (reduces joint load), bracing for malalignment (offloads affected compartment). Avoid: steroids immediately before/after (may interfere with tissue integration)."
    },
    {
      "question": "Is Arthrosamid FDA-approved?",
      "answer": "Arthrosamid has CE Mark approval in Europe (including UK), meaning it meets EU medical device safety standards. It's not yet FDA-approved in the US, which is why it's only available in EU/UK clinics currently. Clinical trials are ongoing in the US. CE Mark is the equivalent European regulatory approval."
    },
    {
      "question": "What happens if I eventually need knee replacement?",
      "answer": "Arthrosamid doesn't complicate future surgery. It integrates into synovial tissue, not bone or cartilage. Orthopedic surgeons simply remove it during joint replacement (it's visible and easy to excise). Multiple EU studies confirm no increased surgical difficulty or complications when replacing knees previously treated with Arthrosamid."
    },
    {
      "question": "How do I know if I'm a good candidate?",
      "answer": "Ideal profile: age 45-75, mild-to-moderate knee OA (grades 2-3), mechanical pain (worse with activity, better with rest), failed conservative care, not yet severe enough for replacement, realistic expectations. Book consultation with recent imaging (X-ray or MRI within 6 months) for assessment. We'll tell you honestly if you're suitable."
