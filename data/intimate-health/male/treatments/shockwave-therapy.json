    "longDescription": "If you've been struggling with erectile dysfunction, you already know it affects more than just your sex life—it impacts your confidence, your relationships, and how you see yourself. By 2025, over 322 million men worldwide face this challenge, yet most suffer in silence. The good news? Your body has an incredible capacity to heal when given the right stimulus.\\n\\nShockwave therapy (LI-ESWT) isn't another pill to mask symptoms for a few hours. It's regenerative medicine that rebuilds your vascular health from the inside out. Using precise acoustic pulses, we trigger your body's natural healing response—angiogenesis—to grow fresh blood vessels where they're needed most. Clinical studies show 57% of men achieve medication-free erections, with improvements lasting 18-24 months or longer.\\n\\nAt Dr. SNA Clinic, we combine FDA-listed focused shockwave technology with Doppler diagnostics, urologist-designed treatment maps, and optional P-Shot® or peptide protocols. Our approach is evidence-based, discreet, and designed for one goal: getting you back to feeling like yourself again—confident, present, and naturally responsive.",

        },
        {
            "question": "How much does shockwave therapy cost in London?",
            "answer": "Single sessions are £350. The 6-Session Course is £1,800 (save £300). The 12-Session Optimiser is £3,200 (save £1,000). Consultation fee (£100) is credited toward treatment. 0% finance available."
        },
        {
            "question": "How many shockwave sessions do I need?",
            "answer": "The standard protocol is 6 sessions over 3 weeks (twice weekly). Some men benefit from 12 sessions if there's significant vascular compromise. We assess progress with Doppler imaging and adjust accordingly."
        },
        {
            "question": "When will I see shockwave results?",
            "answer": "Many men notice stronger morning erections after 3-4 sessions. Maximal gains typically appear 8-12 weeks after completing the course as new blood vessels fully mature."
        },
        {
            "question": "Can I combine shockwave with ED medication?",
            "answer": "Yes. PDE5 inhibitors (Viagra, Cialis) can be used during the course and often become optional once vascular health improves. Many men successfully reduce or eliminate medication dependence."
        },
        {
            "question": "Is shockwave safe with heart conditions?",
            "answer": "If your cardiologist has cleared you for sexual activity, shockwave is usually safe. We review all medications and cardiac history first. Shockwave doesn't affect heart function."
        },
        {
            "question": "How long do shockwave results last?",
            "answer": "Results typically last 18-24 months depending on lifestyle factors. Maintenance sessions annually help sustain vascular health. Many men make yearly boosters part of their wellness routine."
        },
        {
            "question": "Will insurance cover shockwave therapy?",
            "answer": "Shockwave for ED is usually considered elective, but we provide itemised invoices for personal reimbursement if your policy covers regenerative treatments. Check with your provider."
        },
        {
            "question": "What's the difference between shockwave therapy and GAINSWave?",
            "answer": "GAINSWave is a branded protocol using low-intensity shockwave therapy. At Dr. SNA Clinic, we use FDA-listed focused shockwave devices (not radial) with urologist-designed treatment maps. Our approach is evidence-based and customized to your Doppler imaging—not a one-size-fits-all franchise protocol."
        },
        {
            "question": "Can shockwave therapy help if pills don't work for me anymore?",
            "answer": "Absolutely. Double-blind studies show shockwave can convert PDE5 non-responders into responders by addressing the underlying vascular damage. Many men who stopped responding to Viagra or Cialis regain sensitivity to medication after vascular regeneration—or achieve erections without pills entirely."
        },
        {
            "question": "Is shockwave therapy permanent or will I need maintenance?",
            "answer": "Shockwave creates lasting vascular improvements—18-24 months on average—but lifestyle factors (smoking, diabetes, cardiovascular health) affect longevity. Many men opt for annual booster sessions to sustain gains, similar to how you'd maintain muscle with periodic training."
        },
        {
            "question": "What's the success rate for shockwave therapy for ED?",
            "answer": "Clinical studies show effectiveness in up to 84% of men with mild-to-moderate vascular ED. About 57% achieve medication-free erections, and many others see significant improvement in rigidity and spontaneity. Success depends on ED cause, severity, and overall vascular health."
        },
        {
            "question": "Can younger men benefit from shockwave therapy?",
            "answer": "Yes. Younger men with vascular ED (often related to diabetes, metabolic syndrome, or cycling injuries) respond excellently. Early intervention prevents progression and establishes healthy vascular patterns before damage becomes extensive."
        },
        {
            "question": "How does shockwave therapy compare to the P-Shot?",
            "answer": "They're synergistic, not competitive. Shockwave mechanically triggers angiogenesis; P-Shot delivers concentrated growth factors. Many men combine both—shockwave prepares tissue, then PRP amplifies regeneration. Together, they produce faster, more comprehensive results than either alone."
        },
        {
            "question": "Will my partner know I'm having treatment?",
            "answer": "Only if you choose to tell them. Sessions leave no visible marks, require no recovery, and appointments are booked with neutral notes. Many men schedule during work hours and return to normal activity—including intimacy—the same day."
        },
        {
            "question": "What if I have diabetes or high blood pressure?",
            "answer": "Both are manageable with shockwave therapy. We review your medications and may request clearance from your GP or cardiologist. Diabetics often need the 12-session protocol for optimal vascular repair, but results can be excellent with good glycemic control."
