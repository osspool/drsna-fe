We draw a small sample, spin it in a medical-grade centrifuge, and extract platelet-rich plasma loaded with healing proteins. This PRP is injected with ultra-fine needles along the corpora cavernosa and glans to improve blood flow, nerve signalling, and erectile strength. Because it's autologous, there's virtually zero risk of allergic reaction.",
