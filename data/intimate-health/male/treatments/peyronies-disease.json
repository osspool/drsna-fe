  "faq": [
    {
      "question": "Do I need surgery for Peyronie's disease?",
      "answer": "Most men do not. Our regenerative approach can significantly reduce curvature (typically 15-30 degrees) and pain before surgical options are considered. We coordinate with urologists when surgery becomes the better option."
    },
    {
      "question": "How much does Peyronie's treatment cost in London?",
      "answer": "The Core Regenerative Plan (3 PRP + 6 shockwave + traction) is £3,200 (save £500). The Enhanced Plaque Programme is £4,250 (save £750). Consultation fee (£150) includes Doppler imaging and is credited toward treatment. 0% finance available."
    },
    {
      "question": "How many Peyronie's treatment sessions do I need?",
      "answer": "The standard programme is 12 weeks: 3 PRP injections (weeks 0, 4, 8) plus 6 shockwave sessions (twice weekly for 3 weeks) plus daily home traction. Most men see significant improvement within this timeframe."
    },
    {
      "question": "How long do Peyronie's treatment results last?",
      "answer": "Results are long-lasting when plaques are successfully remodelled. Most men maintain improvement for years. Occasional maintenance shockwave or PRP boosters every 6-12 months can help sustain gains."
    },
    {
      "question": "How soon can I resume intercourse after treatment?",
      "answer": "Usually within 24 hours of PRP and immediately after shockwave. We provide personalised guidance based on your specific treatment and comfort level."
    },
    {
      "question": "Does Peyronie's treatment hurt?",
      "answer": "PRP injections involve mild pressure with topical numbing. Shockwave feels like light tapping. Traction causes gentle stretching—we teach comfortable usage and gradually increase tension over days."
    },
    {
      "question": "What if my curvature is severe?",
      "answer": "We work alongside urologists for hybrid plans. Even with >60° curvature, regenerative therapy can improve outcomes pre- or post-surgery. We'll be honest about what regenerative treatment can realistically achieve."
    },
    {
      "question": "Is collagenase (Xiaflex) included?",
      "answer": "Our programme focuses on PRP, shockwave, and traction. If collagenase is appropriate for your case, we can refer you to a surgical colleague who specializes in this treatment."

      "howPerformed": "Your comprehensive programme combines three approaches: (1) PRP injections—your own concentrated platelets are injected directly into the plaque using ultrasound guidance to soften scar tissue, (2) Focused shockwave therapy—acoustic pulses break down calcifications and improve blood flow, delivered painlessly over the plaque area, (3) Traction therapy—you use a specialized device at home that gently stretches tissue while it heals, locking in straighter alignment. We measure curvature with photos and track progress every 4 weeks",
      "preparation": "Get honest with yourself and your partner about expectations—improvement takes 3-4 months. Complete any required imaging (ultrasound or MRI) beforehand. Stop smoking if possible as it slows healing. Come to your first visit having measured your curvature at home. Wear comfortable clothes. Bring a supportive mindset—Peyronie's is frustrating but very treatable",
      "followup": "Use your traction device daily as coached—consistency is everything. Avoid anti-inflammatories for 2 weeks after each PRP session as they can interfere with healing. Continue shockwave sessions as scheduled. Take prescribed supplements to support collagen remodeling. Attend all progress reviews at weeks 4, 8, and 12. Be patient—tissue remodeling is gradual but real",
      "outcome": "Curvature typically improves 15-30 degrees over 3-4 months. Pain during erections disappears as inflammation calms. Erections become firmer as blood flow improves. Many men regain length that was lost to fibrosis. Confidence and intimacy return. While complete straightening isn't always possible, the improvement is life-changing.

  "longDescription": "Peyronie’s disease forms fibrotic plaques under the penile skin, causing curvature, pain, and anxiety. Our regenerative protocol combines platelet-rich plasma (P-Shot®), focused shockwave therapy, traction devices, and prescription topicals to soften plaques, improve symmetry, and restore confidence.\\n\\nRather than relying on surgery or off-label injections alone, we treat the root causes: inflammation, scar tissue, and restricted blood flow. Each plan is customised after Doppler imaging and curvature measurement so you understand every milestone toward straighter, pain-free erections.",
