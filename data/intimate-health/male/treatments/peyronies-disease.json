Our regenerative protocol combines platelet-rich plasma (P-Shot®), focused shockwave therapy, traction devices, and prescription topicals to soften plaques, improve symmetry, and restore confidence.\\n\\nRather than relying on surgery or off-label injections alone, we treat the root causes: inflammation, scar tissue, and restricted blood flow. Each plan is customised after Doppler imaging and curvature measurement so you understand every milestone toward straighter, pain-free erections.",
