By enhancing circulation and neurosensory signalling, it improves orgasm intensity, natural lubrication, and mild urinary leakage without hormones or surgery.\\n\\nAt Dr. SNA Clinic every step—from consultation to aftercare—is handled in private suites by Dr. Syed Nadeem Abbas or our senior female clinicians. We combine dual-spin PRP processing with optional comfort measures and synergistic technologies (Ultra Femme 360, EMSELLA) to create predictable, confidence-building results.",

Growth factors such as PDGF, VEGF, and TGF-β trigger collagen synthesis, nerve sprouting, and microvascular repair.\\n\\nBecause PRP comes from your own body there is virtually zero risk of allergic reaction. Most women notice easier arousal, richer orgasms, improved lubrication, and reduced urinary urgency within a few weeks.",

      "question": "How soon can I have intercourse after the O-Shot?",
      "answer": "You can resume intimacy the same day. Some women prefer to wait 24 hours if there is mild swelling, but it is not medically required."
    },
    {
      "question": "Will it hurt?",
      "answer": "Topical anaesthetic, vibration therapy, and optional nitrous oxide keep discomfort to a mild pressure sensation that lasts seconds."
    },
    {
      "question": "How long do the results last?",
      "answer": "Most patients enjoy benefits for 12-18 months. We offer booster sessions annually if you want to maintain peak results."
    },
    {
      "question": "Is it safe if I’m on HRT?",
      "answer": "Yes. We review your hormone plan and coordinate with your prescribing doctor. PRP is autologous and compatible with HRT."
    },
    {
      "question": "Can the O-Shot help with lichen sclerosus?",
      "answer": "PRP reduces inflammation and improves tissue integrity. We usually combine it with LED light therapy and compounded barrier creams for chronic LS."

      "question": "Do you offer payment plans?",
      "answer": "0% finance is available over 6–12 months. Our coordinators can arrange approvals during your consultation."
