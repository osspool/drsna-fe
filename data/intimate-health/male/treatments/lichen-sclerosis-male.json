Using ultra-fine needles, we inject this concentrated PRP directly into areas of whitening, scarring, or tightness\u2014typically the foreskin, glans, and frenulum. Each micro-injection delivers growth factors that thicken fragile tissue and restore elasticity. Immediately following injections, you receive medical-grade LED phototherapy: red (630nm) and near-infrared (850nm) light is applied to the treatment area for 15 minutes to reduce inflammation and support healing. The entire session takes 45 minutes. We provide custom-compounded barrier creams and detailed hygiene protocols",
            "preparation": "Clean the genital area gently the morning of treatment\u2014no harsh soaps or scrubbing. Wear loose, comfortable underwear and trousers. If you're uncircumcised and experiencing tightness, gently retract foreskin as far as comfortable before arriving (we'll assess fully in clinic). Stop anti-inflammatory medications (ibuprofen, aspirin) 3 days before if medically safe. Bring any previous biopsy results, dermatology letters, or photos documenting progression. Optional chaperone available. Come ready to discuss intimate symptoms openly\u2014this is a clinical, confidential environment. Shave or trim if desired but not required",
            "followup": "Apply prescribed barrier cream twice daily, especially after urination\u2014this prevents micro-tears and seals moisture. Avoid tight underwear and synthetic fabrics for one week. Treated areas may feel warm or slightly swollen for 24-48 hours. Avoid sexual activity for 48 hours to allow tissue healing. Continue LED therapy sessions as scheduled (typically 4 sessions over 2 weeks). Use your digital flare diary to log itching, tightness, or whitening so we can adjust treatment. Attend 2-week and 6-week reviews to assess tissue color, retractability, and comfort. Most men significantly reduce steroid cream frequency after first PRP session. Maintenance LED or PRP boosters every 3-6 months keep symptoms controlled and may help you avoid circumcision",
            "outcome": "Within days, itching and burning sensations calm dramatically as inflammation reduces. Over 4-8 weeks, whitened areas regain healthier pink tone. Skin becomes more elastic\u2014foreskin retracts more easily, reducing phimosis risk. Micro-tears and fissures heal, making intimacy comfortable again. Many men who were facing circumcision successfully preserve their foreskin with diligent treatment and maintenance. Dependence on potent steroid creams drops significantly\u2014you'll use them only during rare flares. The risk of progression to severe scarring, meatal stenosis, or penile cancer reduces when inflammation is controlled. Confidence and quality of life improve. Results last 6-12 months with maintenance; treatment can be repeated as needed. This is lifelong management of a chronic condition",
