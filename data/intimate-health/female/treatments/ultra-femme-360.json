The internal applicator (about the size of a tampon) treats the vaginal canal for 8 minutes—you'll feel soothing warmth, never pain. Then the external applicator smooths and lifts labial tissue for another 8 minutes. No needles, no numbing, no discomfort. Just therapeutic heat that triggers collagen renewal deep within","preparation":"Schedule treatment during the middle of your cycle (not during menstruation).
