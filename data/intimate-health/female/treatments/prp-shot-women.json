This spins in a dual-centrifuge for 8 minutes, separating golden platelet-rich plasma from red blood cells. Using ultra-fine needles, we inject the concentrated PRP into precise points: around the clitoral complex to enhance nerve response, into the G-spot area for improved sensation and lubrication, along delicate vestibular tissue to thicken fragile skin, and around the urethra to support bladder control.

Wear comfortable, loose clothing. Avoid alcohol 24 hours before. Come on an empty bladder. If prone to anxiety, consider bringing headphones with calming music.

Mild swelling or warmth for 24 hours is normal. Avoid hot baths or saunas for 24 hours. No tampons for 3 days (pads okay). Stay well-hydrated to support tissue healing. Most women notice improved lubrication within 2-3 weeks. Sensation and orgasm quality improve over 4-8 weeks as nerve sprouting occurs","outcome":"Within weeks, lubrication returns naturally—no more discomfort or dryness. Orgasms become easier to achieve, stronger, and more reliable. Many women report multiple orgasms for the first time. Bladder control improves for mild stress incontinence.
