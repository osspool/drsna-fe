Each 28-minute session induces over 11,000 supramaximal pelvic floor contractions—far beyond what manual Kegels can achieve. The treatment strengthens the levator ani, restores neuromuscular control, and improves blood flow to the pelvic organs.\\n\\nWe prescribe EMSELLA for women facing stress incontinence, postnatal recovery, menopausal laxity, or decreased intimate sensation. Sessions are non-invasive, pain-free, and performed in a private suite while you remain fully clothed.",
