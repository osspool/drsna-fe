Each 28-minute session induces over 11,000 supramaximal pelvic floor contractions—far beyond what manual Kegels can achieve. The treatment strengthens the levator ani, restores neuromuscular control, and improves blood flow to the pelvic organs.\\n\\nWe prescribe EMSELLA for women facing stress incontinence, postnatal recovery, menopausal laxity, or decreased intimate sensation. Sessions are non-invasive, pain-free, and performed in a private suite while you remain fully clothed.",

      "howPerformed": "You sit fully clothed on a specialized chair that looks like a comfortable seat. High-intensity focused electromagnetic energy (HIFEM) passes through your clothing and penetrates deep into your pelvic floor muscles. This triggers thousands of supramaximal contractions—far more intense than you could ever do manually. It feels like deep pulsing and tingling, never painful. Each 28-minute session delivers over 11,000 perfect Kegel contractions, rebuilding strength and bladder control",
      "preparation": "Come in comfortable, breathable clothing (leggings and top work perfectly). Empty your bladder just before treatment. Stay well-hydrated in the days leading up to your session. No special prep needed—this is the easiest pelvic treatment you'll ever have. Bring headphones if you'd like to listen to music or podcasts during the session",
      "followup": "Resume all activities immediately—work, exercise, intimacy, everything. Drink plenty of water to support muscle recovery. You might feel muscles working for a few hours afterward (like after a good workout). Attend all 6 sessions for best results—consistency is key. Many women notice fewer leaks after just 2-3 sessions, with full results by week 6. Maintenance sessions every 6-9 months keep muscles strong",
      "outcome": "Bladder control improves dramatically—no more leaks when laughing, coughing, running, or jumping. Pelvic floor feels stronger and tighter. Intimacy improves as muscles gain tone and sensation. Posture gets better as your core stabilizes. Confidence returns—no more worrying about finding bathrooms or wearing pads. Many women say it's life-changing, especially for new moms and menopausal women. Results last 6-9 months with maintenance",
