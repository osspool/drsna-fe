Using ultra-fine needles, we inject this golden PRP into affected vulvar tissue\u2014targeting areas of whitening, thinning, or scarring. Each injection delivers growth factors that thicken fragile skin and improve blood flow. Immediately after, you receive medical-grade LED therapy: red (630nm) and near-infrared (850nm) light panels are positioned over the treatment area for 15 minutes to reduce inflammation. The entire session takes 45 minutes. We photograph progress (encrypted, with consent only) and provide custom barrier creams and hygiene kits",
            "preparation": "Come with clean, dry skin\u2014no lotions or creams on vulvar area day of treatment. Shower beforehand if comfortable. Wear loose, comfortable clothing (skirt or loose trousers work well). If you're experiencing a flare, notify us\u2014we may adjust timing. Stop anti-inflammatory medications (ibuprofen) 3 days before if safe. Bring any recent biopsy reports, dermatology letters, or photos documenting your symptoms. Female chaperones available on request. Come ready to discuss intimate symptoms openly in a judgment-free, clinical environment",
            "followup": "Apply the prescribed barrier cream twice daily as directed\u2014this is critical for maintaining moisture and preventing micro-tears. Avoid tight underwear, synthetic fabrics, and harsh soaps for one week. Treated areas may feel slightly warm or puffy for 24-48 hours (ice packs help). Avoid sexual activity for 48 hours to allow healing. Continue LED sessions as scheduled (usually 4 sessions over 2 weeks). Log symptoms in your digital flare diary so we can monitor progress. Attend your 2-week and 6-week reviews\u2014we'll assess tissue color, texture, and comfort. Most women reduce steroid frequency significantly after first PRP session. Maintenance LED or PRP boosters every 3-6 months keep inflammation controlled long-term",
            "outcome": "Within the first week, itching and burning typically calm as inflammation reduces. Over 4-8 weeks, whitened patches gradually regain healthier pink tone. Skin becomes thicker, more elastic, and less prone to tearing during intimacy. Many women report comfortable sexual activity for the first time in years. Dependence on potent steroid creams decreases dramatically\u2014you'll use them only during occasional flares rather than daily. The tissue architecture is protected, reducing risk of fusion, stenosis, or progression to severe scarring. Confidence returns as you regain control over symptoms. Results last 6-12 months with proper maintenance, and you can repeat treatment as needed. This is about managing a chronic condition with dignity and hope",
