  faq: [
    {
      question: "Is the P-Shot painful?",
      answer: "No. We apply a strong numbing cream before the procedure, making it virtually painless. Most patients report feeling minimal discomfort, similar to a standard injection.",
    },
    {
      question: "How quickly will I see results?",
      answer: "Most men notice improvements within 2-4 weeks, with full results visible after 6-12 weeks as new tissue grows. Results continue improving for up to 3 months.",
    },
    {
      question: "How long do P-Shot results last?",
      answer: "Results typically last 12-18 months. Many patients maintain results with annual maintenance treatments. Some men experience benefits for up to 2 years.",
    },
    {
      question: "Can the P-Shot help with erectile dysfunction?",
      answer: "Yes. The P-Shot is highly effective for treating ED, with studies showing 70-80% improvement in erectile function. It works by improving blood flow and regenerating tissue naturally.",
    },
    {
      question: "What size increase can I expect?",
      answer: "Most men gain 10-20% increase in both length and girth. Results vary based on individual physiology, but improvements are measurable and noticeable.",
    },
    {
      question: "Is there any downtime?",
      answer: "No downtime. You can resume normal activities immediately. We recommend avoiding sexual activity for 24-48 hours to allow optimal PRP absorption.",
    },
    {
      question: "Am I a good candidate for the P-Shot?",
      answer: "Most men are excellent candidates. The P-Shot is ideal for those experiencing ED, Peyronie's disease, reduced sensation, or seeking enhancement. A consultation determines suitability.",
    },
    {
      question: "Is the P-Shot safe?",
      answer: "Extremely safe. Since we use your own blood (autologous PRP), there's no risk of allergic reactions or rejection. The procedure is FDA-approved with an excellent safety profile.",
