Working in layers, we carefully place filler into the subcutaneous fat and deep gluteal fascia—building volume in the upper pole for lift, filling hip dips for smoother contours, and enhancing the lower curve for projection. You watch progress in the mirror and give real-time feedback so we can sculpt to your exact vision. Cannulas minimize bruising and avoid blood vessels. Each syringe is placed with precision. The entire session takes 90 minutes","preparation":"Arrive in comfortable, loose clothing (joggers or loose dress work well). Avoid blood-thinning medications and supplements for one week. No alcohol 48 hours before. Eat a good meal beforehand. Bring photos of curves you admire for reference. Plan to avoid sitting directly on buttocks for 48 hours post-treatment (lie on sides or stand). Arrange transport home—you won't want to drive or sit in a car immediately after. Come with realistic expectations about volume and symmetry","followup":"Avoid sitting or lying directly on your buttocks for 48 hours to allow filler to integrate (sleep on your side or stomach). Use a special cushion with cut-out if you must sit. Avoid intense exercise, saunas, and hot baths for one week. Expect significant swelling and possible bruising for 5-10 days—this is normal. Wear loose clothing. Gentle walking encouraged from day one to promote circulation. Attend your 2-week review for assessment and any refinement injections. Final results visible once swelling subsides completely (2-4 weeks)","outcome":"Immediately after treatment, you'll see fuller, rounder curves with lifted upper poles and smoother hip transitions. Once swelling settles (2-4 weeks), contours look natural, soft to touch, and proportionate. You can wear form-fitting clothes with confidence. Results last 12-18 months as hyaluronic acid gradually metabolizes. Treatment is completely reversible with hyaluronidase if you ever want to change or reduce volume. Many patients return for maintenance top-ups yearly to preserve curves","medicationRequired":"Topical numbing cream.
