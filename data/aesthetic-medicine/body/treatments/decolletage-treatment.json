These hydrating and regenerating molecules penetrate the dermis to stimulate collagen, improve elasticity, and fade sun damage. We follow with LED light therapy (red wavelength) to enhance absorption and calm inflammation. The process takes 30 minutes. Tiny bumps smooth within hours","preparation":"Come with clean skin—shower beforehand, no lotions or perfumes on chest. Stop blood-thinning supplements for one week. Avoid sun exposure for 48 hours before. Wear a button-up top for easy access. If you have an event, schedule treatment at least 2 weeks prior to allow full settling. Come ready to protect this area from sun afterward","followup":"Tiny raised bumps at injection points disappear within 12-24 hours. Don't massage or press treated area for 24 hours. Avoid hot showers, saunas, sun exposure, and perfumes for 48 hours. Apply prescribed moisturizer and SPF 50 religiously. Your second and third sessions (4 weeks apart each) complete the course. Skin continues improving for 4-6 weeks as collagen builds","outcome":"Chest skin looks smoother, more hydrated, and radiant. Crepey texture improves dramatically. Sun spots and redness fade.
