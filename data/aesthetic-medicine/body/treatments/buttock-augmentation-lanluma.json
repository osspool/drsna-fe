Using ultra-fine blunt-tipped micro-cannulas, we inject Lanluma® (poly-L-lactic acid) in a fanning pattern into the deep dermal and subdermal layers of your buttocks and hips. The PLLA microparticles act as a scaffold, stimulating your fibroblasts to produce new collagen over the following 6-8 weeks. We use ultrasound guidance for precise depth and placement. Each vial is carefully reconstituted and injected across multiple points to create even, natural lift. The entire session takes 60 minutes. You'll need to massage treated areas 5 minutes daily for 5 days to ensure smooth integration","preparation":"Arrive in comfortable, loose-fitting clothing (joggers or loose dress). Avoid blood-thinning medications and supplements for one week if safe. No alcohol 48 hours before. Eat a good meal beforehand. Bring reference photos of curves you admire. Plan for daily massage commitment post-treatment—this is critical for even results. Arrange light activities only for 48 hours after. Come ready to see gradual transformation over weeks, not instant volume","followup":"Massage treated areas for 5 minutes twice daily for 5 days following treatment—this distributes product evenly and prevents nodules. Gentle walking encouraged from day one. Avoid intense exercise for 48 hours. Sitting is fine (unlike with HA fillers). Expect mild soreness, swelling, or bruising for 2-5 days. Results build gradually as collagen forms—don't expect instant volume. Attend your 8-week review to assess collagen response and plan any second session. Most patients need 1-2 sessions spaced 8-12 weeks apart for optimal results","outcome":"Over 4-8 weeks, your buttocks gradually become fuller, rounder, and more lifted as new collagen forms. Hip dips smooth out. Upper pole gains projection for that coveted 'shelf' appearance. Cellulite and dimpling soften as tissue thickens. The transformation feels completely natural—your own tissue doing the work. Results continue improving for up to 6 months and last 2+ years. Unlike HA fillers, Lanluma creates lasting structural change. Touch-ups every 2-3 years maintain curves","medicationRequired":"Topical numbing cream.
