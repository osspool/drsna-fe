      "howPerformed": "We mark a grid pattern over the sweaty area and apply numbing cream or ice packs. Using ultra-fine needles, tiny amounts of purified botulinum toxin are injected just under the skin across the grid—typically 15-20 injections per underarm. The medicine blocks the nerve signals that trigger sweat glands, effectively switching them off. The whole process takes about 20 minutes. You'll feel small pinpricks but numbing makes it very tolerable",
      "preparation": "Shave underarms 24 hours before (not immediately before—can increase sensitivity). Come in a vest or sleeveless top for easy access. Avoid antiperspirants on treatment day. Eat beforehand to keep blood sugar stable. If treating palms, avoid using your hands heavily for a few hours afterward. Come ready for life-changing dryness",
      "followup": "Avoid intense exercise and hot showers for 24 hours to let the medicine settle. No massage or rubbing of treated areas for 3 days. Antiperspirants can be used after 24 hours (though you won't need them!). Results appear within 3-7 days and peak by 2 weeks. You'll notice shirts staying dry, confident handshakes, and no more sweat anxiety",
      "outcome": "Complete dryness in treated areas for 6-9 months. No more sweat patches, outfit changes, or embarrassing wetness. Handshakes become confident. You can wear any color clothing without worry. Social anxiety around sweating disappears. Your body still sweats elsewhere to regulate temperature—this is safe and targeted. When sweating gradually returns after 6-9 months, simply repeat treatment",

    {
      "question": "Does hyperhidrosis treatment hurt?",
      "answer": "We use numbing cream, ice packs, and vibration distraction to minimize discomfort. You'll feel small pinpricks, but they're brief. Most patients tolerate it well and say it's worth every second for months of dryness."
    },
    {
      "question": "Will I sweat more elsewhere after treatment?",
      "answer": "Compensatory sweating is rare and usually mild if it occurs. Your body has plenty of other sweat glands to regulate temperature naturally. The blocked areas are a small percentage of total sweat glands."
    },
    {
      "question": "How long does hyperhidrosis treatment last?",
      "answer": "Results typically last 6-9 months. Most patients schedule repeat treatments twice yearly. Some find results lasting even longer with regular maintenance."
    },
    {
      "question": "How much does excessive sweating treatment cost in London?",
      "answer": "Underarm treatment (both sides) is £450. Palms or soles are £500 due to thicker skin requiring more product. Consultation and starch-iodine testing (if needed) are included."
    },
    {
      "question": "When will I see results from hyperhidrosis treatment?",
      "answer": "Dryness begins within 3-7 days and reaches full effect by 2 weeks. You'll notice your shirts staying dry and confident handshakes returning. The relief is genuinely life-changing."
    },
    {
      "question": "Is hyperhidrosis treatment safe long-term?",
      "answer": "Yes—Botox for sweating has been used safely for over 20 years with excellent safety records. Your body still regulates temperature through other sweat glands. Many patients have treatments for decades."
    },
    {
      "question": "Can I return to work after hyperhidrosis treatment?",
      "answer": "Yes—there's no downtime. You can return to work immediately. Just avoid intense exercise and hot showers for 24 hours. Most patients book during lunch breaks."
    },
    {
      "question": "Is this treatment covered by insurance?",
      "answer": "Some private health insurance policies cover hyperhidrosis treatment as a medical condition. We provide detailed invoices for reimbursement claims. Check with your provider about coverage for botulinum toxin for excessive sweating."
