We use a grid pattern for even distribution. Lymphatic massage techniques complete the session. Treatment takes 30-45 minutes per area","preparation":"Stay very well-hydrated for 3 days before (drink 3+ liters daily). Avoid alcohol and salty foods for 48 hours. Wear comfortable, loose clothing you don't mind getting slightly stained. Come ready for visible swelling—it's dramatic but temporary. Arrange light activities for 2-3 days after","followup":"Drink lots of water to support lymphatic drainage. Gentle walking encouraged from day one. Use compression garments if treating large areas. Avoid intense exercise, alcohol, and saunas for 5 days. Manual lymphatic drainage massage at day 3-5 enhances results. Expect swelling, bruising, and tenderness for 3-7 days. Attend 6-week review to assess and plan additional sessions if needed","outcome":"Over 4-8 weeks, dimples gradually smooth out as fat cells shrink and skin tightens. Thighs and hips appear more contoured. Circulation improves. Skin texture becomes silkier. Results are lasting with stable weight and healthy lifestyle.
