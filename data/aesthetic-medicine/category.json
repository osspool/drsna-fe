  "faq": [
    {
      "question": "Are aesthetic treatments safe?",
      "answer": "Yes, when performed by qualified practitioners. All our treatments are FDA/CE approved and administered by experienced medical professionals in a CQC-registered clinic. We prioritize safety and use only premium, clinically-proven products."
    },
    {
      "question": "How long do results last?",
      "answer": "Duration varies by treatment. Anti-wrinkle injections typically last 3-6 months, dermal fillers 6-18 months, and regenerative treatments like PRP can show improvement for 12+ months. We'll provide specific timelines during your consultation."
    },
    {
      "question": "Is there any downtime?",
      "answer": "Most aesthetic treatments require minimal to no downtime. You may experience slight redness or swelling for a few hours to a couple of days, but most clients return to normal activities immediately. We'll give you detailed aftercare guidance."
    },
    {
      "question": "Will I look 'overdone' or unnatural?",
      "answer": "Not at all. Our philosophy centers on natural enhancement. We aim to refresh and rejuvenate your appearance while maintaining your unique facial characteristics and expressions. Subtle, sophisticated results are our specialty."
    },
    {
      "question": "When will I see results?",
      "answer": "This depends on the treatment. Anti-wrinkle injections take 3-14 days, dermal fillers show immediate results that improve over 2 weeks, and regenerative treatments like PRP develop gradually over 4-12 weeks as collagen production increases."
    },
    {
      "question": "How do I choose the right treatment?",
      "answer": "During your consultation, we'll assess your concerns, skin condition, and aesthetic goals to recommend the most appropriate treatments. Many clients benefit from combination approaches for optimal results."
