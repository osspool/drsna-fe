    {
      "question": "How long does swelling last?",
      "answer": "Most swelling subsides within 48 hours; full settling occurs by day seven. Ice packs and sleeping elevated help reduce swelling faster."
    },
    {
      "question": "How long do lip fillers last?",
      "answer": "Lip fillers typically last 9-12 months depending on metabolism, product choice, and lifestyle. Some patients find results last longer with repeated treatments as filler builds a foundation."
    },
    {
      "question": "Do lip fillers hurt?",
      "answer": "We use topical numbing cream and can add a dental block for sensitive patients. Most describe mild pressure rather than pain. The filler also contains lidocaine for added comfort during injection."
    },
    {
      "question": "How much do lip fillers cost in London?",
      "answer": "Our lip enhancement starts from \u00a3295 for 0.7ml (subtle refresh) up to \u00a3395 for 1ml with border definition. Consultation fee (\u00a350) is credited toward treatment."
    },
    {
      "question": "Can lip filler be dissolved if I don't like it?",
      "answer": "Yes, hyaluronic acid fillers can be dissolved with hyaluronidase enzyme. Results are visible within 24-48 hours. We offer this service if you're unhappy or have migration from previous treatments elsewhere."
    },
    {
      "question": "How many ml of filler do I need for my lips?",
      "answer": "Most first-timers achieve beautiful results with 0.5-1ml. We recommend starting conservatively\u2014you can always add more at your 2-week review. Overfilling creates an unnatural look we avoid."
    },
    {
      "question": "Can I get lip filler if I get cold sores?",
      "answer": "Yes, but we recommend taking antiviral medication (like Valtrex) starting 24 hours before treatment to prevent an outbreak. We can prescribe this at your consultation if needed."

      "howPerformed": "After applying numbing cream (and optional dental block for extra comfort), hyaluronic acid gel is injected into precise points along your lips using ultra-fine needles or a flexible cannula. We build volume gradually\u2014starting with structure in the border to define your shape, then adding soft fullness throughout. You watch in the mirror as we sculpt, ensuring perfect symmetry. The gel instantly plumps lips while attracting water for natural hydration",
      "preparation": "Avoid blood-thinning supplements (fish oil, vitamin E, aspirin) for one week before treatment. No alcohol 48 hours prior. Come hydrated and having eaten. Bring inspiration photos showing lip shapes you admire. If you're prone to cold sores, start antiviral medication 24 hours before (we can prescribe). Arrive with clean lips\u2014no lipstick or gloss",
      "followup": "Apply ice packs for 20 minutes every few hours for the first day\u2014this reduces swelling dramatically. Sleep elevated for two nights. Avoid intense kissing, hot drinks, spicy food, and strenuous exercise for 24 hours. No lipstick for 24 hours. Swelling peaks at 24-48 hours then improves rapidly. Attend your 2-week review for assessment and any refinement (complimentary)",
      "outcome": "Immediately fuller, more defined lips with beautiful symmetry. Your Cupid's bow stands out. Lips feel soft and move naturally when you smile or talk. The hydration makes lips look healthy and kissable. Swelling settles within a week, revealing your final result. You look like yourself\u2014just with the lips you've always wanted.
