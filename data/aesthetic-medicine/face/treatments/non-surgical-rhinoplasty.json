  "faq": [
    {
      "question": "Is it safe?",
      "answer": "Yes. We use cannula technique with aspiration and carry hyaluronidase (dissolving enzyme) on-site. Our doctors have advanced vascular knowledge specific to nasal anatomy. It's one of our safest procedures when performed correctly."
    },
    {
      "question": "Will it make my nose bigger?",
      "answer": "No—filler adds structure strategically, which often makes the nose appear smaller and straighter. By smoothing bumps and lifting the tip, the overall profile looks more refined and proportionate."
    },
    {
      "question": "How long does liquid rhinoplasty last?",
      "answer": "Results typically last 12-18 months—longer than most facial fillers because the nose moves less. Some patients find results lasting up to 2 years. Touch-ups maintain your refined profile."
    },
    {
      "question": "Does non-surgical rhinoplasty hurt?",
      "answer": "We thoroughly numb the nose with topical and injectable local anaesthetic for complete comfort. Most patients feel only mild pressure during injection. The procedure is very tolerable."
    },
    {
      "question": "How much does liquid rhinoplasty cost in London?",
      "answer": "Our Classic Liquid Rhino (bridge smoothing + tip lift) is £450. The Profile Perfect package (rhinoplasty + chin/jawline balancing) is £650 (save £100). Consultation fee (£75) is credited toward treatment."
    },
    {
      "question": "Can nose filler be dissolved if I don't like it?",
      "answer": "Yes, this is one of the biggest advantages of liquid rhinoplasty—it's completely reversible. Hyaluronidase enzyme dissolves HA filler within 24-48 hours if you want to return to your original nose or make changes."
    },
    {
      "question": "What can non-surgical rhinoplasty fix?",
      "answer": "Liquid rhinoplasty can smooth dorsal humps, lift droopy tips, straighten bridges, improve symmetry, and refine post-surgical irregularities. It cannot reduce nose size or correct breathing issues—we refer to ENT surgeons for functional concerns."
    },
    {
      "question": "How much filler is used for liquid rhinoplasty?",
      "answer": "Most nose refinements use 0.5-1ml of filler. We use conservative amounts for natural results—you can always add more at your review. Less is more with nasal filler."

      "howPerformed": "After numbing your nose thoroughly, a blunt-tipped micro-cannula is gently inserted through a tiny entry point. Smooth hyaluronic acid gel is carefully threaded along the nasal bridge to camouflage bumps, or placed at the tip to create lift. We shape and sculpt as we go, checking your profile from every angle. The cannula glides smoothly without piercing blood vessels. You can see results instantly in the mirror, and we adjust until you're thrilled. The whole process takes about 20 minutes",
      "preparation": "Arrive with clean skin—no makeup. Stop blood-thinning supplements for one week. Avoid alcohol 48 hours before. Bring photos of noses you admire from every angle (front, profile, three-quarter). Have realistic expectations—filler can camouflage and refine but can't reduce size. Come ready to see your profile transformed",
      "followup": "Apply ice packs for 20 minutes every few hours on day one. Avoid touching, pressing, or sleeping face-down for 48 hours. No glasses resting on bridge for one week (use tape to suspend them or wear contacts). Skip intense workouts for 24 hours. Avoid saunas and facials for one week. Swelling is minimal. Attend your 2-week review to assess and refine if needed",
      "outcome": "Your profile immediately looks straighter and more balanced. Dorsal humps blend into a smooth line. Droopy tips lift elegantly. Your nose appears more refined from every angle. Friends notice you look better but can't pinpoint why. Best part? It's completely reversible if you ever want to change.
