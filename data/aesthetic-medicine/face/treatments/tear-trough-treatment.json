Doctor-only injections, cannula technique, and optional PN boosters for bright results.","h1":"Tear Trough Treatment in London","keywords":["tear trough filler london","under eye filler","dark circle treatment","non surgical eye bags"],"schema":{"@type":"MedicalProcedure","procedureType":"NoninvasiveProcedure","bodyLocation":"Under-eye area (tear trough deformity)","howPerformed":"After applying numbing cream, a tiny flexible cannula (blunt-tipped tube) is gently inserted under your eye. Ultra-light hyaluronic acid gel is carefully placed beneath the hollow, filling the shadow and blending smoothly into your cheek. The cannula glides through tissue rather than piercing—this reduces bruising dramatically. We check symmetry from every angle, massaging gently to ensure natural contour","preparation":"Arrive with clean, makeup-free skin. Stop blood-thinning supplements (arnica, fish oil, vitamin E) one week before. Avoid alcohol 48 hours prior. Bring sunglasses for the journey home—eyes may look slightly puffy initially. Eat beforehand as low blood sugar can increase bruising risk. Relax knowing this is one of our most requested confidence-boosters","followup":"Apply ice packs for 20 minutes every few hours on day one. Sleep elevated for two nights to minimize swelling. Avoid rubbing or pressing the area for 48 hours. Skip intense workouts, saunas, and alcohol for 24 hours. Makeup can be worn after 24 hours. Attend your 2-week review—we'll assess settling and add tiny touch-ups if needed (complimentary)","outcome":"Instantly brighter, more rested eyes. The dark shadow and tired look disappear. Your face looks years younger without anyone knowing you've had treatment. Filler settles beautifully over 2 weeks, blending seamlessly. Results last 12-18 months. You'll stop hearing 'you look tired' and start hearing 'you look amazing'","medicationRequired":"Topical numbing cream applied 20 minutes before treatment","medicalSpecialty":"Aesthetic Medicine","relevantSpecialty":"Oculofacial Aesthetics","isProprietary":false,"treatmentFrequency":"Single session with optional 2-week refinement.
