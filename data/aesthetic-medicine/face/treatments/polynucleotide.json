  "longDescription": "Polynucleotides (PN) are DNA fragments that supercharge your skin’s repair response. We micro-inject PN along cheeks, temples, and jawline to hydrate deeply, reduce redness, and tighten texture. Think of it as a skin reboot that pairs beautifully with fillers, lasers, or PRP—ideal for anyone craving lit-from-within radiance without downtime.",

      "howPerformed": "After cleansing and numbing your skin, ultra-fine needles deliver micro-droplets of purified polynucleotide (DNA fragments) across your face using bio-aesthetic points. These DNA building blocks penetrate the dermal layer, where they signal your fibroblasts to ramp up collagen and elastin production. They also attract water molecules for deep hydration and calm inflammatory pathways that cause redness. The process takes about 30 minutes. You'll see tiny bumps that smooth within hours",
      "preparation": "Come with clean, makeup-free skin. Stay super hydrated for 3 days before (drink 2-3 liters daily). Stop blood-thinning supplements for one week. Avoid alcohol and processed foods 48 hours before—PN works best in a clean system. If you have sensitive or rosacea-prone skin, this is your ideal treatment. Come ready for regeneration",
      "followup": "Tiny injection bumps disappear within 12-24 hours. Don't massage or press treated areas for 24 hours. Avoid makeup, intense exercise, saunas, and direct sun for 24 hours. Drink lots of water to support cellular repair. Your second session 3 weeks later completes the course. Skin continues improving for 4-6 weeks as collagen rebuilds",
      "outcome": "Skin looks plumper, more hydrated, and luminous—the lit-from-within glow. Fine lines soften. Texture becomes smoother and more refined. Redness calms dramatically. Pores appear smaller. Your complexion reflects light beautifully. Makeup sits flawlessly. Unlike fillers, PN doesn't add volume—just pure skin quality improvement. Results last 6-9 months",
