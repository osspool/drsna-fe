    "title": "What Are Anti-Wrinkle Injections?",
    "content": "Anti-wrinkle injections use a purified protein (botulinum toxin type A) to temporarily relax specific facial muscles. When these muscles relax, the overlying skin becomes smooth, reducing the appearance of wrinkles and fine lines. This treatment is particularly effective for expression lines—wrinkles that form when you smile, frown, or squint.\n\nAt Dr. SNA Clinic, we use premium, FDA-approved products and advanced injection techniques to ensure natural-looking results that enhance your appearance without compromising facial expression.",

  "faq": [
    {
      "question": "Does it hurt?",
      "answer": "Most clients describe the sensation as a minor pinch or mosquito bite. We use ultra-fine needles and advanced techniques to minimize discomfort. The entire treatment takes just 10-15 minutes, making any discomfort very brief. No anesthetic is typically required."
    },
    {
      "question": "Will I look frozen or unnatural?",
      "answer": "Absolutely not when performed correctly. Our expert injectors use precise dosing and strategic placement to soften wrinkles while maintaining natural facial expressions. You'll look refreshed and relaxed, not frozen. The goal is to enhance your natural beauty, not change it."
    },
    {
      "question": "How long until I see results?",
      "answer": "Results appear gradually over 3-14 days, with full effects visible by 2 weeks. Some people notice initial softening within 3-4 days, while others take the full 2 weeks. We offer a complimentary review at 2 weeks to assess results and make any adjustments."
    },
    {
      "question": "How long do results last?",
      "answer": "Results typically last 3-6 months, depending on factors like metabolism, muscle strength, and the area treated. Forehead and crow's feet tend to last 4-5 months, while stronger muscles (like frown lines) may require more frequent treatment. With regular maintenance, results can last longer over time."
    },
    {
      "question": "Are there any side effects?",
      "answer": "Common side effects are minor and temporary: slight redness, mild swelling, or small bruises at injection sites, usually resolving within hours to a few days. Headache occurs in 1-2% of patients. Serious side effects are rare when performed by qualified practitioners. We'll discuss all risks during consultation."
    },
    {
      "question": "What should I avoid after treatment?",
      "answer": "For 24 hours: avoid lying down for 4 hours, intense exercise, alcohol, facials, massages, or rubbing treated areas. Avoid blood-thinning supplements (like fish oil, vitamin E) for a week before treatment to minimize bruising. We provide detailed aftercare instructions."
    },
    {
      "question": "When is the best age to start?",
      "answer": "There's no single 'right' age. Many people start preventatively in their late 20s to early 30s when fine lines first appear. Others begin later when wrinkles are more established. The best time is when you notice lines that bother you. We treat patients from their mid-20s to 70s+."
    },
    {
      "question": "Can men have this treatment?",
      "answer": "Absolutely! Anti-wrinkle injections are increasingly popular with men ('Brotox'). Men often require slightly higher doses due to stronger facial muscles. We tailor treatments to maintain masculine features while reducing lines."
    },
    {
      "question": "How much does it cost?",
      "answer": "Pricing depends on the areas treated and amount of product required. Single area treatments start from £195, with package deals available for multiple areas. We'll provide an exact quote during your consultation. Many clients treat 2-3 areas in one session."
    },
    {
      "question": "Is it safe during pregnancy or breastfeeding?",
      "answer": "As a precaution, we do not treat pregnant or breastfeeding women. While no harm has been reported, there isn't sufficient research in these populations. We recommend waiting until after you've finished breastfeeding."
    },
    {
      "question": "What's the difference between brands (Botox, Dysport, etc.)?",
      "answer": "All FDA-approved brands (Botox, Dysport, Azzalure, Bocouture) contain the same active ingredient and work similarly. Small differences exist in spread and duration. At Dr. SNA Clinic, we use premium brands and will discuss which is best for your specific needs."
    },
    {
      "question": "Can I combine this with other treatments?",
      "answer": "Yes! Anti-wrinkle injections work beautifully with dermal fillers (to address both dynamic and static wrinkles), skin boosters, and laser treatments. Many clients combine treatments for comprehensive facial rejuvenation. We'll create a personalized combination plan."
