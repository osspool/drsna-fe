We prioritize your unique journey to beauty and well-being, ensuring a transformative and satisfying experience. We're located at 48 Wimpole Street, Marylebone, London and provide professional, medically-led treatments."
    },
    {
      "question": "How do I book a consultation?",
      "answer": "Booking a consultation is easy! Simply give us a call at +44 7955836986, or use our online booking form. Our friendly team will guide you through the process for wrinkle treatments reduction marylebone. The consultation fee is £100 which can be offset against your treatment plan."
    },
    {
      "question": "What is the downtime for anti-wrinkle treatments?",
      "answer": "Anti-wrinkle treatment downtime is minimal. Most patients resume their daily activities immediately after the procedure. You can return to work immediately. Our team will provide detailed post-treatment care instructions during your consultation. It takes up to a week for the treatment to fully activate, with results lasting up to 6 months."
    },
    {
      "question": "Does it hurt?",
      "answer": "Most clients describe the sensation as a minor pinch or mosquito bite. We use ultra-fine needles and advanced techniques to minimize discomfort. The entire treatment takes around 30 minutes, making any discomfort very brief. No anesthetic is typically required."
    },
    {
      "question": "Will I look frozen or unnatural?",
      "answer": "Absolutely not when performed correctly. Our expert injectors use precise dosing and strategic placement to soften wrinkles while maintaining natural facial expressions. You'll look refreshed and relaxed, not frozen. The goal is to enhance your natural beauty, not change it."
    },
    {
      "question": "How long until I see results?",
      "answer": "Results appear gradually over 3-14 days, with full effects visible by 2 weeks. Some people notice initial softening within 3-4 days, while others take the full 2 weeks. We offer a complimentary review at 2 weeks to assess results and make any adjustments."
    },
  
    {
      "question": "How much does it cost?",
      "answer": "Pricing depends on the areas treated and amount of product required. Single area treatments start from £250, with package deals available for multiple areas (2 areas £325, 3 areas £400). There is a £100 consultation fee which can be offset against your treatment plan. We'll provide an exact quote during your consultation. Many clients treat 2-3 areas in one session."
    },
    {
      "question": "Is it safe during pregnancy or breastfeeding?",
      "answer": "As a precaution, we do not treat pregnant or breastfeeding women. While no harm has been reported, there isn't sufficient research in these populations. We recommend waiting until after you've finished breastfeeding."
    },
    {
      "question": "What's the difference between brands (Botox, Dysport, etc.)?",
      "answer": "All FDA-approved brands (Botox, Dysport, Azzalure, Bocouture) contain the same active ingredient and work similarly. Small differences exist in spread and duration. At Dr. SNA Clinic, we use premium brands and will discuss which is best for your specific needs."
    },
    {
      "question": "Can I combine this with other treatments?",
      "answer": "Yes! Anti-wrinkle injections work beautifully with dermal fillers (to address both dynamic and static wrinkles), skin boosters, and laser treatments. Many clients combine treatments for comprehensive facial rejuvenation. We'll create a personalized combination plan."
