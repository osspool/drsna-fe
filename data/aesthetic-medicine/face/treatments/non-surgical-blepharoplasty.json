  "faq": [
    {
      "question": "How does non-surgical compare to surgical blepharoplasty?",
      "answer": "Non-surgical is best for mild to moderate concerns, offering subtler results with minimal downtime and lower cost. Surgery is more suitable for severe hooding or excess skin. Non-surgical results last 6-12 months vs. surgery's 10+ years. However, many prefer non-surgical's natural appearance, safety profile, and ability to adjust gradually."
    },
    {
      "question": "Will I still need surgery eventually?",
      "answer": "Not necessarily. Many patients maintain results with periodic maintenance treatments indefinitely. However, if significant excess skin develops, surgery may eventually be more appropriate. Non-surgical treatments can also postpone surgery for years while maintaining a refreshed appearance."
    },
    {
      "question": "Is treatment around the eyes safe?",
      "answer": "Yes, when performed by experienced practitioners. The eye area requires specialized knowledge of anatomy and advanced injection techniques. We use blunt-tip cannulas when appropriate, inject conservatively, and have extensive training in periorbital treatments. Serious complications are extremely rare."
    },
    {
      "question": "Does it hurt?",
      "answer": "Most patients find it tolerable with numbing cream. The eye area is sensitive, so you may feel pressure or slight pinching. Plasma pen treatment can be more uncomfortable but is manageable. Most describe it as brief discomfort worth enduring for the results."
    },
    {
      "question": "What's the downtime?",
      "answer": "Minimal. Expect mild swelling and possible bruising for 3-7 days. Under-eye filler often causes more swelling initially. Plasma pen may cause tiny scabs for 5-7 days. Most patients return to work next day with concealer. Avoid makeup for 24 hours."
    },
    {
      "question": "Which technique is best for me?",
      "answer": "This depends on your specific concerns. Hooding typically needs brow lift (anti-wrinkle); hollows need filler; excess skin may need plasma pen. Most patients benefit from a combination approach. We'll assess and recommend during consultation."
    },
    {
      "question": "How long do results last?",
      "answer": "Varies by technique: anti-wrinkle (3-4 months), tear trough filler (9-12 months), plasma pen (permanent skin tightening with gradual aging). Most patients return every 6-12 months for maintenance to sustain results."
    },
    {
      "question": "Can I wear makeup afterwards?",
      "answer": "Avoid makeup for 24 hours post-treatment. After that, use concealer to camouflage any bruising or swelling. Avoid waterproof or difficult-to-remove makeup that requires harsh rubbing. Be gentle when applying and removing products."
    },
    {
      "question": "What if I don't like the results?",
      "answer": "Filler-based treatments are reversible with hyaluronidase. Anti-wrinkle effects fade naturally over 3-4 months. Plasma pen results develop gradually, allowing assessment. We offer complimentary review appointments to assess and adjust if needed."
    },
    {
      "question": "Am I too young/old for this treatment?",
      "answer": "Age isn't the primary factor—your specific concerns are. Patients typically range from late 30s to 70s+. Younger patients often have brow lift or tear trough filler; older patients may need combination approaches. Suitability determined during consultation."
    },
    {
      "question": "Can this help with naturally puffy eyes?",
      "answer": "Strategic filler placement can minimize the appearance of bags by smoothing the transition, but true puffy bags (fat pads) may be better addressed surgically. We'll assess whether you're a good candidate during consultation."
    },
    {
      "question": "How much does it cost?",
      "answer": "Pricing varies based on techniques used. Single treatments start from £350. Combination approaches range from £600-1,200. Still significantly less than surgical blepharoplasty (£3,000-6,000). Exact quote provided during consultation."
