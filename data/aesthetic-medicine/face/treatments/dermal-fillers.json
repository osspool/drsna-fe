We apply numbing cream before treatment, and many modern fillers contain lidocaine (local anesthetic) for comfort. Most describe the sensation as pressure or mild stinging. Sensitive areas like lips may be more tender, but most find it very tolerable."},{"question":"How long do dermal fillers last?","answer":"Duration varies by product and area: lips (6-9 months), nasolabial folds (9-12 months), cheeks (12-18 months), jawline/chin (12-18 months). Factors affecting longevity include metabolism, lifestyle, area treated, and product chosen. Regular top-ups help maintain results."},{"answer":"Not when performed by skilled injectors. Our philosophy focuses on subtle, natural enhancement that respects your facial proportions. We use conservative amounts and build gradually. You'll look like a refreshed, more youthful version of yourself—not like a different person.","question":"Will I look overdone or fake?"},{"question":"What's the difference between brands (Juvederm, Restylane, etc.)?","answer":"All premium brands use hyaluronic acid but differ in formulation, texture, and durability. Juvederm has a smooth, cohesive gel ideal for lips and fine lines. Restylane has a granular structure providing more lift—excellent for cheeks and contouring. We'll select the best product for your specific needs."},{"answer":"Yes! One key advantage of hyaluronic acid fillers is they're completely reversible. An enzyme called hyaluronidase can dissolve the filler within 24-48 hours if you're unhappy with results. This provides important peace of mind, though dissolution is rarely needed.","question":"Can fillers be reversed if I don't like them?"},{"question":"What should I avoid before treatment?","answer":"For 1 week before: avoid blood-thinning supplements (fish oil, vitamin E, ginger, ginkgo), alcohol, and aspirin/ibuprofen unless medically necessary. These increase bruising risk. Continue prescription medications. Arrive with clean, makeup-free skin if possible."},{"answer":"Immediate results with mild swelling and possible bruising for 3-7 days. Swelling peaks at 24-48 hours, particularly with lips. You can apply makeup after 24 hours. Results improve as swelling subsides over 2 weeks. Most people resume normal activities immediately.","question":"What can I expect after treatment?"},{"question":"Are there any risks or side effects?","answer":"Common side effects are temporary: swelling, bruising, redness, and tenderness for a few days. Rare complications include lumps (usually massage-able), infection, or vascular occlusion (blocked blood vessel—extremely rare with experienced injectors). We take extensive precautions to minimize risks."},{"question":"How much filler will I need?","answer":"This varies significantly based on your goals and anatomy. Lips typically require 0.5-1ml, cheeks 2-4ml per side, nasolabial folds 1-2ml total. We often recommend starting conservatively and building over multiple sessions for natural results. Exact amounts determined during consultation."},{"question":"Can I combine fillers with other treatments?","answer":"Absolutely! Fillers pair beautifully with anti-wrinkle injections (addressing both volume loss and expression lines), skin boosters, and PRP treatments. Many patients achieve optimal results through combination approaches. We'll create a comprehensive treatment plan."},{"answer":"You'll see immediate improvement, but final results appear after 2 weeks once swelling resolves and product settles. Some products (like Voluma) continue improving for 4 weeks as they integrate and attract water. Be patient—the wait is worth it!","question":"When will I see final results?"},{"answer":"Pricing depends on product type and volume needed. Single area treatments start from £295 (0.5-1ml). Full face rejuvenation using multiple syringes ranges from £800-1,500. We'll provide an exact quote during consultation. Payment plans available.","question":"How much do dermal fillers cost?"}],"hero":{"badge":"Most Versatile Treatment","headline":"Sculpt, Restore, Transform","video":null,"subheadline":"Premium dermal fillers for age-defying beauty and perfect proportions","image":"https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1629425733761-caae3b5f2e50?w=1920&q=80","backgroundImage":"https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1616394584738-fc6e612e71b9?w=1920&q=80"},"instagram":{"handle":"@drsnaclinic","enabled":true,"hashtags":["#DermalFillers","#LipFiller","#CheekFiller","#NaturalResults"],"title":"Follow Our Transformations"}}
