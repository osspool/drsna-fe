    "content": "Dermal fillers are soft, gel-like substances injected beneath the skin to restore lost volume, enhance facial contours, and smooth away wrinkles. Most modern fillers use hyaluronic acid (HA)—a naturally occurring substance in your body that retains moisture and provides volume.\n\nAt Dr. SNA Clinic, we exclusively use premium, FDA-approved brands like Juvederm and Restylane, known for their safety profile and natural results. Our expert injectors use advanced techniques to create subtle enhancements that honor your unique facial architecture.",

  "faq": [
    {
      "question": "Do dermal fillers hurt?",
      "answer": "Most patients experience mild discomfort rather than pain. We apply numbing cream before treatment, and many modern fillers contain lidocaine (local anesthetic) for comfort. Most describe the sensation as pressure or mild stinging. Sensitive areas like lips may be more tender, but most find it very tolerable."
    },
    {
      "question": "How long do dermal fillers last?",
      "answer": "Duration varies by product and area: lips (6-9 months), nasolabial folds (9-12 months), cheeks (12-18 months), jawline/chin (12-18 months). Factors affecting longevity include metabolism, lifestyle, area treated, and product chosen. Regular top-ups help maintain results."
    },
    {
      "question": "Will I look overdone or fake?",
      "answer": "Not when performed by skilled injectors. Our philosophy focuses on subtle, natural enhancement that respects your facial proportions. We use conservative amounts and build gradually. You'll look like a refreshed, more youthful version of yourself—not like a different person."
    },
    {
      "question": "What's the difference between brands (Juvederm, Restylane, etc.)?",
      "answer": "All premium brands use hyaluronic acid but differ in formulation, texture, and durability. Juvederm has a smooth, cohesive gel ideal for lips and fine lines. Restylane has a granular structure providing more lift—excellent for cheeks and contouring. We'll select the best product for your specific needs."
    },
    {
      "question": "Can fillers be reversed if I don't like them?",
      "answer": "Yes! One key advantage of hyaluronic acid fillers is they're completely reversible. An enzyme called hyaluronidase can dissolve the filler within 24-48 hours if you're unhappy with results. This provides important peace of mind, though dissolution is rarely needed."
    },
    {
      "question": "What should I avoid before treatment?",
      "answer": "For 1 week before: avoid blood-thinning supplements (fish oil, vitamin E, ginger, ginkgo), alcohol, and aspirin/ibuprofen unless medically necessary. These increase bruising risk. Continue prescription medications. Arrive with clean, makeup-free skin if possible."
    },
    {
      "question": "What can I expect after treatment?",
      "answer": "Immediate results with mild swelling and possible bruising for 3-7 days. Swelling peaks at 24-48 hours, particularly with lips. You can apply makeup after 24 hours. Results improve as swelling subsides over 2 weeks. Most people resume normal activities immediately."
    },
    {
      "question": "Are there any risks or side effects?",
      "answer": "Common side effects are temporary: swelling, bruising, redness, and tenderness for a few days. Rare complications include lumps (usually massage-able), infection, or vascular occlusion (blocked blood vessel—extremely rare with experienced injectors). We take extensive precautions to minimize risks."
    },
    {
      "question": "How much filler will I need?",
      "answer": "This varies significantly based on your goals and anatomy. Lips typically require 0.5-1ml, cheeks 2-4ml per side, nasolabial folds 1-2ml total. We often recommend starting conservatively and building over multiple sessions for natural results. Exact amounts determined during consultation."
    },
    {
      "question": "Can I combine fillers with other treatments?",
      "answer": "Absolutely! Fillers pair beautifully with anti-wrinkle injections (addressing both volume loss and expression lines), skin boosters, and PRP treatments. Many patients achieve optimal results through combination approaches. We'll create a comprehensive treatment plan."
    },
    {
      "question": "When will I see final results?",
      "answer": "You'll see immediate improvement, but final results appear after 2 weeks once swelling resolves and product settles. Some products (like Voluma) continue improving for 4 weeks as they integrate and attract water. Be patient—the wait is worth it!"
    },
    {
      "question": "How much do dermal fillers cost?",
      "answer": "Pricing depends on product type and volume needed. Single area treatments start from £295 (0.5-1ml). Full face rejuvenation using multiple syringes ranges from £800-1,500. We'll provide an exact quote during consultation. Payment plans available."
