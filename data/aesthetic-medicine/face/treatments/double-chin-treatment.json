This is actually a sign the treatment is working. Wear the compression band and massage gently as instructed to support drainage."},{"question":"Are Aqualyx results permanent?","answer":"Yes—destroyed fat cells are gone for good. However, weight gain can create new fat cells in the area. Maintain a stable weight and healthy lifestyle for lasting results. Most patients find their sleeker profile is strong motivation to stay in shape."},{"question":"How many Aqualyx sessions do I need?","answer":"Most patients need 2-3 sessions spaced 6-8 weeks apart for optimal double chin reduction. Some achieve their goal with 2 sessions, while larger fat deposits may need 3. We assess progress at each review and plan accordingly."},{"question":"Does Aqualyx hurt?","answer":"You'll feel stinging and warmth during injection as the solution works. The product contains lidocaine for comfort, and we thoroughly numb the area beforehand. Most patients rate discomfort as moderate but manageable. Tenderness continues for a few days after."},{"question":"How much does double chin treatment cost in London?","answer":"Single Aqualyx sessions are £350. Our Dual Session Slim (2 sessions + compression kit) is £650 (save £50). The Ultimate Profile (3 sessions + jawline filler tweak) is £1,050 (save £150). Consultation fee (£75) is credited toward treatment."},{"question":"When will I see double chin results?","answer":"Results appear gradually over 4-8 weeks as destroyed fat is eliminated through your lymphatic system. You'll notice progressive slimming with each session. Final results are visible 6-8 weeks after your last treatment."},{"question":"Can I exercise after Aqualyx?","answer":"Avoid intense exercise for one week after treatment. Gentle walking is fine after 48 hours. Exercise increases blood flow which can worsen swelling. Light massage and compression support better lymphatic drainage during recovery."},{"question":"Is Aqualyx better than liposuction for double chin?","answer":"Aqualyx is ideal for moderate submental fat with good skin elasticity—no surgery, no general anaesthetic, minimal downtime. For larger fat deposits or significant skin laxity, surgical liposuction or neck lift may give better results. We'll recommend the most effective option during consultation."}],"pricing":{"singlePrice":{"currency":"GBP","currentPrice":"£350"},"packages":[{"savings":"Save £50","description":"2 sessions + compression kit","includes":"LED healing","price":"£650","name":"Dual Session Slim"},{"description":"3 sessions + jawline filler tweak","includes":"Aftercare bundle + review","name":"Ultimate Profile","price":"£1,050","savings":"Save £150"}],"includes":["Consultation & diagramming","Aqualyx product","Aftercare plan + check-in"],"subtitle":"Consultation fee (£75) credited toward treatment","title":"Pricing"},"hero":{"badge":"No surgery • Minimal downtime","headline":"Wave Goodbye to Submental Fullness","subheadline":"Doctor-only Aqualyx injections sculpt a tighter jawline in 2-3 sessions.","image":"https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1524504388940-b1c1722653e1?w=1920&q=80"},"overview":{"content":"Aqualyx contains deoxycholic acid, a bile acid that breaks down fat cell membranes.

Each injection delivers medicine that breaks down fat cell membranes. The destroyed fat is then naturally eliminated by your lymphatic system over 4-8 weeks. The treatment includes lidocaine for comfort. You'll feel pressure and stinging initially, followed by warmth as the solution works. Total time is about 20-30 minutes","preparation":"Arrive with clean skin. Stop blood-thinning supplements for one week. Avoid alcohol 48 hours before. Eat a light meal—don't come on an empty stomach. Bring a compression band or scarf to wear afterward (we provide these). Come mentally prepared for swelling—it's dramatic but temporary. Arrange light activities for 2-3 days after","followup":"Apply ice packs for 20 minutes every few hours for the first 2 days. Wear compression garment for 3-5 days to reduce swelling and support drainage. Avoid intense exercise, alcohol, and saunas for one week. Gently massage the area as instructed to encourage fat breakdown. Expect significant swelling (chipmunk effect) for 3-7 days—this is normal and means it's working. Attend your 6-week review to assess and plan any booster session","outcome":"Over 4-8 weeks, your chin area gradually slims down. The jawline becomes more defined and elegant.
