      "howPerformed": "After cleansing your skin and applying numbing cream, ultra-fine needles deliver micro-droplets of hyaluronic acid (and sometimes vitamins or amino acids) just below the skin's surface. We use a technique called bio-aesthetic points (BAP)—specific injection sites that allow the HA to spread evenly throughout tissue. Each droplet hydrates deeply, attracts water molecules, and stimulates collagen production. The process takes about 20 minutes. You'll see tiny bumps immediately that smooth out within hours",
      "preparation": "Come with clean skin—no makeup. Stay well-hydrated for 2-3 days before (drink at least 2 liters of water daily). Avoid alcohol 24 hours before. Stop blood-thinning supplements for one week. If you have an event, schedule treatment at least 10 days prior to allow full settling. Come ready to glow",
      "followup": "Tiny raised bumps at injection points are normal—they disappear within 12-24 hours. Don't massage or press on treated areas for 24 hours. Avoid makeup, intense exercise, saunas, and sun exposure for 24 hours. Stay super hydrated to maximize HA hydration effect. Your second session 4 weeks later completes the course. Skin continues improving for 4-6 weeks as collagen builds",
      "outcome": "Skin looks dewy, plump, and radiant—the 'glass skin' glow everyone wants. Fine lines soften. Pores appear smaller. Crepey texture smooths out. Under-eyes look less hollow. Your complexion reflects light beautifully. Makeup glides on flawlessly. The hydration lasts 6 months, then you can repeat. It's prevention and treatment in one",

      "question": "Do skin boosters replace filler?",

      "question": "Will I bruise from skin boosters?",

      "question": "How long do skin booster results last?",
      "answer": "Results typically last 6-9 months. We recommend maintenance sessions every 6 months to keep that hydrated glow. Longevity improves with good skincare and hydration."

    {
      "question": "What's the difference between Profhilo and other skin boosters?",
      "answer": "Profhilo uses pure hyaluronic acid that spreads under skin for bio-remodelling and lift. Redensity I adds vitamins for fine lines. Jalupro includes amino acids for rejuvenation. Dr Abbas recommends based on your specific concerns."

      "question": "How much do skin boosters cost in London?",
      "answer": "Single sessions start from £250. Our Profhilo Duo course (2 sessions + LED) is £500, and the Ultimate Glow Plan (Profhilo + Redensity I combo) is £750. Consultation fee (£50) is credited toward treatment."
    },
    {
      "question": "Do skin booster injections hurt?",
      "answer": "We use topical numbing cream, so most patients feel only mild pinpricks. The BAP technique uses just 5-10 injection points per area, making it quick and tolerable."
    },
    {
      "question": "How many skin booster sessions do I need?",
      "answer": "Most protocols require 2 sessions spaced 4 weeks apart for initial results. After that, maintenance every 6 months preserves the glow. Some patients add quarterly boosters before events."
    },
    {
      "question": "Can I have skin boosters before an event?",
      "answer": "Yes, but allow at least 10 days before your event. Tiny bumps resolve within 24 hours, but full settling and optimal glow take 7-10 days. Many patients book pre-wedding or holiday courses."
