  "faq": [
    {
      "question": "Will it affect swallowing?",
      "answer": "No. We target the superficial platysma bands only; the deeper swallowing muscles remain completely untouched. This is a safe, well-established technique when performed by experienced injectors."
    },
    {
      "question": "How often do I repeat the Nefertiti Lift?",
      "answer": "Every 3-4 months to maintain your lifted jawline. Many patients schedule standing quarterly appointments. The effect gradually wears off as the muscle regains strength, so regular maintenance keeps results consistent."
    },
    {
      "question": "How long does the Nefertiti Lift last?",
      "answer": "Results typically last 3-4 months—similar to anti-wrinkle injections. Some patients find results last up to 5 months depending on muscle strength and metabolism. Consistent treatments can extend longevity over time."
    },
    {
      "question": "Does the Nefertiti Lift hurt?",
      "answer": "Most patients describe tiny pinpricks—the needles are ultra-fine. We can apply topical numbing cream, but most don't need it. The procedure takes only 15-20 minutes and discomfort is minimal."
    },
    {
      "question": "How much does the Nefertiti Lift cost in London?",
      "answer": "Our Nefertiti Refresh (standard dosing) is £325. The Contour Plus (with jawline filler touch-up + LED) is £495 (save £85). Consultation fee (£50) is credited toward treatment. Maintenance patients often book packages."
    },
    {
      "question": "When will I see Nefertiti Lift results?",
      "answer": "Results develop gradually over 7-14 days as the muscles relax. You'll notice your jawline becoming sharper and neck bands softening. Full results are visible by 2 weeks, which is when we schedule your review."
    },
    {
      "question": "Can I combine the Nefertiti Lift with other treatments?",
      "answer": "Yes—it pairs beautifully with jawline filler for maximum definition, or skin boosters for neck texture. Many patients combine it with anti-wrinkle injections for the forehead in the same session for convenience."
    },
    {
      "question": "Is the Nefertiti Lift suitable for turkey neck?",
      "answer": "Yes, it's excellent for visible platysma bands (vertical neck cords). For significant skin laxity, we may recommend combining with Profound RF or referring to a surgeon. Dr Abbas will assess your specific anatomy during consultation."

      "howPerformed": "After mapping the visible platysma bands and jawline, we inject tiny amounts of botulinum toxin using ultra-fine needles along specific points—starting just below your jawline and extending down your neck in a pattern named after Queen Nefertiti. The medicine relaxes these downward-pulling muscles, allowing your natural facial structure to lift. The jawline appears sharper and more defined. Vertical neck bands (turkey neck) soften beautifully. Treatment takes about 15 minutes and feels like tiny pinpricks",
      "preparation": "Arrive with clean skin—no makeup or lotions on your neck. Stop blood-thinning supplements for 3 days if possible. Avoid alcohol 24 hours before. Wear a top with a wide neckline for easy access. Eat beforehand. Come ready to see your jawline emerge",
      "followup": "Stay upright for 4 hours after treatment—no lying flat or bending forward. Avoid rubbing, massaging, or applying pressure to your neck for 24 hours. No intense exercise or hot yoga for 24 hours. Results develop gradually over 7-14 days as the muscles relax. You'll notice your jawline becoming more defined and neck bands softening. Attend your 2-week review to assess and add tiny refinements if needed",
      "outcome": "Jawline looks sharper and more sculpted. Vertical neck bands disappear or dramatically soften. The lower face appears lifted and more elegant. Your profile looks younger in photos. Neck skin lays smoother. Many patients say they finally see their jawline again. Results last 3-4 months, then you repeat treatment to maintain that regal contour",
