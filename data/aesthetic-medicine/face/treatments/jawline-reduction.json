    {
      "question": "Will it look masculine?",
      "answer": "Only if that's your goal. We customize the ratio and angles for each face—whether you want a more feminine, masculine, or androgynous result. Dr Abbas maps your facial proportions and discusses your vision before any treatment."
    },
    {
      "question": "How long do jawline filler results last?",
      "answer": "Filler lasts 12-18 months because we place it deep onto bone where there's minimal movement. Masseter slimming (Botox) needs a refresher every 6 months as the muscle gradually regains strength. Fat-dissolving results are permanent."
    },
    {
      "question": "Does jawline filler hurt?",
      "answer": "We apply topical numbing cream and can add a dental nerve block for complete comfort. Most patients feel only pressure during cannula placement. The procedure is very tolerable, and we check in with you throughout."
    },
    {
      "question": "How much does jawline sculpting cost in London?",
      "answer": "Single-area treatment starts from £450. Our Sharp Contour (2ml filler + LED) is £795. The Complete Profile (3ml filler + masseter slimming or fat-dissolving) is £1,150 (save £150). Consultation fee (£75) is credited toward treatment."
    },
    {
      "question": "Will I bruise from jawline filler?",
      "answer": "Bruising is possible but minimized by our cannula technique—only one entry point rather than multiple needle pricks. If bruising occurs, it's usually small and easily covered. Avoiding blood thinners beforehand helps significantly."
    },
    {
      "question": "How much filler do I need for a defined jawline?",
      "answer": "Most patients need 2-4ml total for meaningful definition (1-2ml per side). We start conservatively and can add more at your 2-week review. Men often need more volume than women. We never overfill on first session."
    },
    {
      "question": "Can jawline filler be dissolved?",
      "answer": "Yes, hyaluronic acid jawline fillers can be dissolved with hyaluronidase if needed. However, this is rarely necessary when treatment is done by experienced injectors who understand facial proportions and use conservative amounts."
    },
    {
      "question": "What's the difference between jawline filler and masseter slimming?",
      "answer": "Jawline filler adds volume and structure—ideal for weak chins or undefined jaws. Masseter slimming (Botox) reduces bulky jaw muscles—ideal for square faces. Many patients benefit from both: slimming the muscle while adding filler for contour."

Each technique is mapped to your facial anatomy. Treatment takes 30-60 minutes total",
      "preparation": "Arrive with clean skin—no makeup. Stop blood-thinning supplements for one week. Avoid alcohol 48 hours before. If having masseter treatment, eat a good meal beforehand (you'll want to avoid heavy chewing after). Bring photos showing jaw/chin shapes you admire from multiple angles. Come ready to see your profile transform",
      "followup": "Apply ice packs for 20 minutes every few hours for the first day (filler treatment). If masseter slimming, avoid chewing gum and tough foods for 24 hours. No lying flat or intense exercise for 48 hours after filler. Sleep elevated for two nights. Avoid massaging jawline for one week. Attend your 2-week review for assessment and refinement",
      "outcome": "Jawline appears sharper, more defined, and sculpted. Chin looks balanced and proportionate. Wide jaws slim down elegantly (masseter treatment takes 6-8 weeks to show full effect). Profile looks camera-ready from every angle. Your lower face appears lifted and youthful. Confidence soars. Filler results last 12-18 months; masseter slimming needs repeat every 6 months",
