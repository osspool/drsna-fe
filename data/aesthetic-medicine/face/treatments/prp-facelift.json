By extracting, concentrating, and reinjecting your platelet-rich plasma (PRP), we trigger natural collagen production, improve skin texture, and restore a youthful glow—all without surgery or synthetic substances.","faq":[{"answer":"Most patients find PRP comfortable with topical numbing cream. Blood draw is like a standard blood test. The injections feel like tiny pinpricks—tolerable for most. The entire procedure is less uncomfortable than most expect. We prioritize your comfort throughout.","question":"Does PRP Facelift hurt?"},{"question":"How long until I see results?","answer":"You'll notice an initial glow within 1-2 weeks as growth factors activate. However, PRP works gradually by stimulating collagen production. Visible improvements appear around 4-6 weeks, with optimal results at 3-6 months. Patience pays off—natural regeneration takes time!"},{"answer":"Results can last 12-18 months, sometimes longer. Unlike fillers that dissolve, PRP stimulates your own collagen which persists. Many patients do annual maintenance treatments to sustain results. The improvements continue developing for months after treatment.","question":"How long do PRP results last?"},{"question":"How many treatments do I need?","answer":"We typically recommend 3 treatments spaced 4-6 weeks apart for optimal results, followed by annual maintenance. Younger patients (late 20s-30s) may need fewer sessions, while mature skin or severe concerns may benefit from additional treatments. Customized during consultation."},{"answer":"Minimal. Expect redness and possible mild swelling for 24-48 hours, similar to a sunburn. Small bruises at injection sites are possible. Most patients return to work the next day. Avoid makeup for 24 hours and strenuous exercise for 48 hours.","question":"What's the downtime?"},{"question":"Is PRP safe?","answer":"Extremely safe. Since we use your own blood, there's virtually no risk of allergic reaction or disease transmission. Risks are minimal—primarily bruising or infection (very rare with sterile technique). PRP has been used in medicine for decades with excellent safety records."},{"answer":"Yes! PRP works beautifully with microneedling (highly recommended), dermal fillers, and anti-wrinkle injections. Many patients do PRP for overall skin quality and add fillers for volume. The combinations are synergistic, each enhancing the other's results.","question":"Can I combine PRP with other treatments?"},{"answer":"They're similar. 'Vampire Facial' typically refers to PRP combined with microneedling, popularized by celebrities. 'PRP Facelift' usually involves injection only. We offer both approaches and will recommend what's best for your specific concerns and skin type.","question":"What's the difference between PRP Facelift and Vampire Facial?"},{"answer":"PRP works for a wide age range. Younger patients (late 20s-30s) use it preventatively and for skin quality. Patients 40+ use it for rejuvenation and anti-aging. It's effective from late 20s through 60s+. Suitability determined during consultation based on your specific concerns.","question":"Am I too young/old for PRP?"},{"question":"What should I avoid before PRP treatment?","answer":"For 1 week before: avoid blood-thinning supplements (fish oil, vitamin E, aspirin, ibuprofen) to minimize bruising. Continue prescription medications. Avoid alcohol 24 hours before. Arrive well-hydrated and having eaten. Stop retinoids 3 days before if combining with microneedling."},{"answer":"Absolutely! PRP is increasingly popular with men seeking natural skin improvement. It's particularly effective for acne scarring, large pores, rough texture, and overall skin health. No one will know you've had treatment—you'll just look healthier and more refreshed.","question":"Can men have PRP treatments?"}],"hero":{"backgroundImage":"https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1616394584738-fc6e612e71b9?w=1920&q=80","image":"https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1556228578-8c89e6adf883?w=1920&q=80","video":null,"subheadline":"Regenerate, rejuvenate, and glow from within using your body's own healing power","headline":"Nature's Most Powerful Anti-Aging Secret","badge":"100% Natural Treatment"},"instagram":{"enabled":true,"handle":"@drsnaclinic","title":"See PRP Results on Instagram","hashtags":["#PRPFacelift","#VampireFacial","#NaturalBeauty","#SkinRejuvenation"]},"comparison":{"comparisons":[{"duration":"12-18 months","downtime":"Minimal","results":"Gradual, long-lasting","cost":"Moderate","naturalness":"100% Natural","treatment":"PRP Facelift"},{"duration":"6-18 months","downtime":"Minimal","results":"Immediate","treatment":"Dermal Fillers","cost":"Moderate","naturalness":"Synthetic"},{"downtime":"Moderate","duration":"12+ months","cost":"High","naturalness":"Technology-based","treatment":"Laser Treatment","results":"Gradual"},{"downtime":"Significant","duration":"10+ years","cost":"Very High","naturalness":"Invasive","treatment":"Surgical Facelift","results":"Dramatic"}],"title":"PRP vs. Other Treatments","subtitle":"How does PRP compare?"},"description":"Natural skin rejuvenation using your own platelet-rich plasma to stimulate collagen and restore youthful radiance",  "beforeAfter": {

The result is naturally younger-looking, healthier skin."}}
