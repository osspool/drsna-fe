    "title": "What is a PRP Facelift?",
    "content": "A PRP Facelift uses your own blood's healing properties to rejuvenate your skin naturally. We draw a small amount of blood (similar to a routine blood test), separate the platelet-rich plasma using centrifugation, and inject this concentrated 'liquid gold' back into your face.\n\nPRP contains powerful growth factors that stimulate collagen production, improve skin texture and tone, reduce fine lines, and promote overall skin health. Unlike synthetic fillers, PRP works by activating your body's natural regenerative processes for gradual, long-lasting improvements.",

    "content": "Platelets are tiny cells in your blood that contain growth factors essential for healing and tissue regeneration. When you cut yourself, platelets rush to the injury and release these growth factors to repair tissue. \n\nBy concentrating platelets and injecting them into facial skin, we trigger this same healing response—stimulating collagen production, increasing blood flow, and activating stem cells. The result is naturally younger-looking, healthier skin.",

  "faq": [
    {
      "question": "Does PRP Facelift hurt?",
      "answer": "Most patients find PRP comfortable with topical numbing cream. Blood draw is like a standard blood test. The injections feel like tiny pinpricks—tolerable for most. The entire procedure is less uncomfortable than most expect. We prioritize your comfort throughout."
    },
    {
      "question": "How long until I see results?",
      "answer": "You'll notice an initial glow within 1-2 weeks as growth factors activate. However, PRP works gradually by stimulating collagen production. Visible improvements appear around 4-6 weeks, with optimal results at 3-6 months. Patience pays off—natural regeneration takes time!"
    },
    {
      "question": "How long do PRP results last?",
      "answer": "Results can last 12-18 months, sometimes longer. Unlike fillers that dissolve, PRP stimulates your own collagen which persists. Many patients do annual maintenance treatments to sustain results. The improvements continue developing for months after treatment."
    },
    {
      "question": "How many treatments do I need?",
      "answer": "We typically recommend 3 treatments spaced 4-6 weeks apart for optimal results, followed by annual maintenance. Younger patients (late 20s-30s) may need fewer sessions, while mature skin or severe concerns may benefit from additional treatments. Customized during consultation."
    },
    {
      "question": "What's the downtime?",
      "answer": "Minimal. Expect redness and possible mild swelling for 24-48 hours, similar to a sunburn. Small bruises at injection sites are possible. Most patients return to work the next day. Avoid makeup for 24 hours and strenuous exercise for 48 hours."
    },
    {
      "question": "Is PRP safe?",
      "answer": "Extremely safe. Since we use your own blood, there's virtually no risk of allergic reaction or disease transmission. Risks are minimal—primarily bruising or infection (very rare with sterile technique). PRP has been used in medicine for decades with excellent safety records."
    },
    {
      "question": "Can I combine PRP with other treatments?",
      "answer": "Yes! PRP works beautifully with microneedling (highly recommended), dermal fillers, and anti-wrinkle injections. Many patients do PRP for overall skin quality and add fillers for volume. The combinations are synergistic, each enhancing the other's results."
    },
    {
      "question": "What's the difference between PRP Facelift and Vampire Facial?",
      "answer": "They're similar. 'Vampire Facial' typically refers to PRP combined with microneedling, popularized by celebrities. 'PRP Facelift' usually involves injection only. We offer both approaches and will recommend what's best for your specific concerns and skin type."
    },
    {
      "question": "Am I too young/old for PRP?",
      "answer": "PRP works for a wide age range. Younger patients (late 20s-30s) use it preventatively and for skin quality. Patients 40+ use it for rejuvenation and anti-aging. It's effective from late 20s through 60s+. Suitability determined during consultation based on your specific concerns."
    },
    {
      "question": "What should I avoid before PRP treatment?",
      "answer": "For 1 week before: avoid blood-thinning supplements (fish oil, vitamin E, aspirin, ibuprofen) to minimize bruising. Continue prescription medications. Avoid alcohol 24 hours before. Arrive well-hydrated and having eaten. Stop retinoids 3 days before if combining with microneedling."
    },
    {
      "question": "Can men have PRP treatments?",
      "answer": "Absolutely! PRP is increasingly popular with men seeking natural skin improvement. It's particularly effective for acne scarring, large pores, rough texture, and overall skin health. No one will know you've had treatment—you'll just look healthier and more refreshed."
