Smooth hyaluronic acid gel is carefully layered deep onto your cheekbone to create lift, then refined near the surface for soft fullness. The cannula glides smoothly—no multiple needle pricks. We check your face from every angle, comparing symmetry in the mirror with you. The result is sculpted, lifted cheeks that catch light beautifully","preparation":"Arrive with clean, makeup-free skin. Stop blood-thinning supplements (fish oil, vitamin E, aspirin) one week before. Avoid alcohol 48 hours prior. Eat a proper meal beforehand—low blood sugar increases bruising risk. Bring inspiration photos showing cheek shapes you love. We'll map your face and design volume placement just for you","followup":"Apply ice packs for 20 minutes every few hours for the first day. Sleep elevated for two nights. Avoid intense workouts, saunas, and face-down positions for 48 hours. No facial massage for one week. Makeup can be worn after 24 hours. Attend your 2-week review where we'll assess settling and add tiny refinements if needed (included)","outcome":"Immediately lifted, more youthful mid-face. Your eyes appear brighter as shadows disappear. Smile lines soften naturally. The lower face looks more supported and elegant. Filler settles beautifully over 2 weeks, moving naturally when you smile or talk. Results last 12-18 months.

Dr Abbas follows a 'less is more' philosophy—you'll look refreshed, never overdone."},{"question":"Does it move when I smile?","answer":"We place filler deep and secure, so it moves like your own tissue. You can laugh, smile, and make expressions naturally."},{"question":"How long do cheek fillers last?","answer":"Cheek fillers typically last 12-18 months. Because we place filler deep onto the bone where there's less movement, longevity is excellent. Touch-ups are usually only needed yearly."},{"question":"Does cheek filler hurt?","answer":"We apply topical numbing cream and can add a dental nerve block for extra comfort. Most patients describe mild pressure rather than pain. The cannula technique we use is gentler than multiple needle pricks."},{"question":"How much does cheek augmentation cost in London?","answer":"Our Subtle Lift (1ml) is £395. The Signature Contour (2ml + tear trough touch-up) is £695 (save £95). Consultation fee (£75) is credited toward treatment. 0% finance available."},{"question":"Will I bruise from cheek filler?","answer":"Bruising is minimal with our cannula technique—only one entry point versus multiple needle pricks. If bruising occurs, it's typically small and easily covered with makeup after 24 hours."},{"question":"How much filler do I need for cheeks?","answer":"Most patients achieve beautiful results with 1-2ml (0.5-1ml per side). First-timers often start with 1ml for subtle lift, then add more at review if desired. We never overfill on first session."},{"question":"Can cheek filler be dissolved if I don't like it?","answer":"Yes, hyaluronic acid cheek fillers can be dissolved with hyaluronidase enzyme if needed. However, this is rarely necessary when treatment is done conservatively by experienced injectors."}]}
