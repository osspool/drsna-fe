    {

Common starting points include anti-wrinkle injections for lines, dermal fillers for volume loss, and skin boosters for overall skin quality. During your consultation, we'll assess your face and recommend the most appropriate treatment or combination."
    },
    {
      "question": "Will facial treatments make me look 'done' or frozen?",
      "answer": "Absolutely not. Our philosophy focuses on natural-looking enhancement. We use advanced injection techniques and appropriate product amounts to ensure you maintain natural facial expressions while looking refreshed and rejuvenated."
    },
    {
      "question": "How long do facial aesthetic treatments last?",
      "answer": "Duration varies by treatment: anti-wrinkle injections last 3-6 months, dermal fillers 6-18 months depending on the area and product, and regenerative treatments like PRP can show benefits for 12-18 months. We'll provide specific timelines for your chosen treatments."
    },
    {
      "question": "Are there any side effects?",
      "answer": "Common temporary side effects include mild redness, swelling, or bruising at injection sites, typically resolving within hours to a few days. Serious complications are rare when treatments are performed by qualified practitioners. We'll discuss all potential risks during your consultation."
    },
    {
      "question": "Can I combine multiple facial treatments?",
      "answer": "Yes! Many clients achieve optimal results through combination treatments. For example, pairing anti-wrinkle injections with dermal fillers addresses both dynamic and static aging. We'll create a comprehensive treatment plan that works synergistically."
    },
    {
      "question": "When is the best age to start facial aesthetic treatments?",
      "answer": "There's no single 'right' age. Some people start preventatively in their late 20s with anti-wrinkle injections, while others begin in their 40s or beyond. The best time is when you notice concerns that bother you. We'll assess your individual needs regardless of age."
    },
    {
      "question": "How much do facial aesthetic treatments cost?",
      "answer": "Prices vary by treatment complexity and product amount required. Anti-wrinkle injections start from £195, dermal fillers from £295, and advanced treatments like PRP from £450. We'll provide a detailed quote during your consultation."
    },
    {
      "question": "Is there any downtime with facial treatments?",
      "answer": "Most treatments require minimal to no downtime. Anti-wrinkle injections have virtually none, while filler treatments may cause slight swelling for 1-3 days. PRP and polynucleotide treatments may have mild redness for 24-48 hours. You can typically resume normal activities immediately."
