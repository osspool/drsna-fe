We often combine both for synergistic results—exosomes for deep follicle stimulation and PRP for growth factor support. Best choice depends on your thinning severity."},{"answer":"Some shedding at weeks 2-4 is normal as follicles reset and enter a new growth phase. This temporary shed is actually a positive sign—new baby hairs typically appear by week 6-8 as stronger hairs replace weak ones.","question":"Will I shed after exosome treatment?"},{"question":"How much does exosome hair treatment cost?","answer":"A single exosome session is £1,400 including LED therapy and supplements. The Exosome + PRP Fusion package is £1,950 (save £350). Consultation fee (£100) is credited toward treatment. 0% finance available."},{"question":"How long do exosome hair results last?","answer":"Results typically last 12-18 months with proper maintenance. Many patients add quarterly PRP boosters to sustain momentum. Hair grown from exosome therapy is your own natural hair that follows normal growth cycles."},{"question":"When will I see hair growth from exosomes?","answer":"New baby hairs typically appear at 6-8 weeks. Noticeable density improvement develops over 3-6 months as follicles regenerate and produce thicker, stronger hair. Full results continue building for up to 12 months."},{"question":"Is exosome hair therapy safe?","answer":"Yes, exosome therapy is very safe. We use sterile, lab-purified exosomes from verified sources. Side effects are minimal—pink scalp for 12-24 hours and possible temporary shedding as follicles reset. No hormones or surgery involved."},{"question":"Can I combine exosomes with other hair treatments?","answer":"Absolutely. Exosomes work synergistically with PRP, Regenera® micro-grafts, and polynucleotides. Many patients continue using minoxidil or finasteride alongside exosome therapy. Dr Abbas will recommend the optimal combination for your case."},{"question":"How many exosome sessions do I need for hair regrowth?","answer":"Most patients achieve significant results with 1-2 sessions spaced 6 weeks apart. For advanced thinning, we may recommend quarterly boosters or combination protocols with PRP. Your treatment plan is customized to your hair loss pattern."}],"id":"exosome-treatment","shortTitle":"Exosome Hair","candidacy":{"title":"Who Should Consider Exosomes?","note":"We coordinate with your dermatologist or endocrinologist when needed.","notSuitable":["Pregnancy or breastfeeding","Active scalp infection","Auto-immune alopecia without consultant approval"],"suitable":["Patients plateauing on PRP or medication","Diffuse thinning women","Men preferring drug-free solutions","Anyone wanting accelerated regrowth"]},"seo":{"metaTitle":"Exosome Hair Treatment London | Advanced Hair Regrowth | Dr. SNA Clinic","canonicalUrl":"/treatments/aesthetic-medicine/hair/exosome-treatment","metaDescription":"Experience exosome hair therapy in London.

Medical-grade exosomes (tiny cellular messengers derived from stem cells) are delivered via ultra-fine micro-injections across thinning areas. We also use microneedling to drive exosomes deeper into the scalp. These powerful signals tell dormant follicles to wake up and grow. The process takes about 45 minutes, followed by a soothing mask and LED therapy to enhance results","preparation":"Wash hair with gentle shampoo the morning of treatment. Stop minoxidil and scalp treatments 3 days before. Avoid blood-thinning supplements for one week. Eat a good meal beforehand. Come with patience—exosome therapy works at the cellular level, so results build over weeks. This is advanced treatment for people serious about regrowth","followup":"Don't wash hair for 24 hours to let exosomes fully absorb. Scalp may look pink for 12-24 hours—this is normal healing. Avoid intense exercise, swimming, and saunas for 48 hours. Follow the prescribed supplement and topical regimen. Some shedding may occur at weeks 2-4 as follicles reset—this is temporary and a sign treatment is working. New baby hairs typically appear by week 6-8","outcome":"Follicles that were dormant or weak start producing thicker, stronger hairs. Thinning areas fill in gradually over 3-6 months. Hair density improves measurably. Scalp inflammation reduces, creating healthier growing conditions. Results are dramatic when combined with PRP or Regenera. Effects last 12-18 months.
