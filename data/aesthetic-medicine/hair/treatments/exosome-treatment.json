  "description": "Lab-purified exosomes deliver powerful growth signals to stubborn follicles, igniting regrowth when standard treatments plateau.",
  "longDescription": "Exosomes are microscopic messengers derived from stem cells. They’re loaded with cytokines, mRNA, and growth factors that instruct dormant follicles to wake up. Injected or microneedled across the scalp, exosomes spark faster regrowth, reduce inflammation, and enhance the results of PRP or Regenera®—all without hormones or surgery.",

    "title": "Why Exosomes?",
    "content": "Think of exosomes as the text messages of your cells. They tell follicles to grow, calm inflammation, and repair damage. We source sterile, medical-grade exosomes and deliver them via micro-injections or microneedling for maximum absorption. Results arrive faster than PRP alone, making exosomes a go-to for advanced thinning or patients seeking a performance boost.",
