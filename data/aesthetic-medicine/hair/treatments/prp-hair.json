    {
      "question": "Does PRP hair treatment hurt?",
      "answer": "Numbing cream plus vibration analgesia make treatments very tolerable. We can add nitrous oxide for anxious patients. Most describe it as mild pressure rather than pain."
    },
    {
      "question": "When will I see new hair growth?",
      "answer": "Initial improvements in hair quality appear within 4-6 weeks. Significant new growth typically becomes visible around 8-12 weeks as follicles regenerate. Peak results at 6 months."
    },
    {
      "question": "Will PRP work for my type of hair loss?",
      "answer": "PRP works best for androgenetic alopecia (male/female pattern thinning), stress-related shedding, and early-stage hair loss where follicles are still active. Complete baldness with non-active follicles is not suitable."
    },
    {
      "question": "Are PRP hair results permanent?",
      "answer": "PRP stimulates natural regrowth which can be long-lasting with proper maintenance. Most patients benefit from booster sessions every 6-9 months to protect and maintain results."
    },
    {
      "question": "How much does PRP hair treatment cost?",
      "answer": "A single session is £450. Our recommended 3-session PRP Starter Series is £1,050 (save £300), which includes LED therapy and supplements. Consultation fee (£75) is credited toward treatment."
    },
    {
      "question": "Is PRP hair treatment safe?",
      "answer": "Yes, PRP is very safe because we use your own blood—zero risk of rejection or allergic reaction. Temporary scalp tenderness or minor bruising may occur. Our clinic is CQC-registered with GMC-certified doctors."
    },
    {
      "question": "Can PRP be combined with other hair treatments?",
      "answer": "Absolutely. We often layer PRP with exosomes, Regenera® micro-grafts, or polynucleotide boosters for accelerated regrowth. Many patients also continue minoxidil or finasteride alongside PRP."
    },
    {
      "question": "How many PRP sessions do I need for hair?",
      "answer": "We recommend 3 initial sessions spaced 4 weeks apart for optimal results. After that, maintenance boosters every 6-9 months help sustain hair density and prevent further thinning."

      "howPerformed": "A small blood sample is gently drawn from your arm, similar to a routine blood test. This sample is then placed in an advanced dual-spin centrifuge that separates and concentrates your platelets to 5-6 times their normal levels, creating a powerful healing serum. Using precise injection techniques with ultra-fine needles or a specialized meso-gun device, this concentrated PRP is carefully delivered into targeted areas of your scalp where thinning or hair loss has occurred. Topical numbing cream is applied beforehand to ensure your complete comfort throughout the 20-minute injection process.",
      "preparation": "Arrive with clean, dry hair and avoid using any styling products, oils, or conditioners on treatment day. If you're taking blood-thinning medications or supplements like aspirin, fish oil, or vitamin E, please discuss these with your doctor at least one week before treatment as they may need to be paused temporarily. Stay well-hydrated in the days leading up to your appointment. An optional topical numbing cream will be applied 30 minutes before your procedure to maximize comfort.",
      "followup": "For the first 24 hours after treatment, avoid washing your hair or getting your scalp wet to allow the PRP to fully absorb and begin its regenerative work. You may experience mild scalp tenderness or redness, which typically resolves within a day. Soothing LED light therapy is provided immediately after your treatment to reduce inflammation and enhance healing. You'll receive a personalized home care kit including supplements and gentle topical treatments to support your results. Plan to return for two additional sessions spaced 4 weeks apart to complete your initial treatment series. After that, maintenance sessions every 6-9 months help sustain your improved hair density and protect against future thinning.",
      "outcome": "Within the first 4-6 weeks, you'll likely notice your hair feels stronger and you're losing fewer strands when brushing or washing. By 8-12 weeks, visible new growth typically begins to emerge as dormant follicles awaken and start producing hair again. Hair thickness, density, and overall volume continue to improve over the following months, with peak results appearing around 6 months post-treatment. Many patients report renewed confidence as their hairline fills in, their part line narrows, and their hair regains the fullness they remember. Results can last 12-18 months or longer with proper maintenance care.",
