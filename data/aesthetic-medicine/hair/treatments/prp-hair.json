  "longDescription": "PRP harnesses the healing power in your own blood. We draw a small sample, concentrate the platelets up to 6x baseline, and inject them across the scalp using ultra-fine needles. Growth factors like PDGF, VEGF, and IGF flood the follicles, boost blood flow, and extend the growth phase. Expect stronger strands, less shedding, and a thicker hairline—without drugs or surgery.",

    "title": "Why PRP Works for Hair",
    "content": "Platelets are packed with growth factors that kick-start healing anywhere they’re placed. Injected into the scalp, they increase blood flow, revive dormant follicles, and strengthen the hair shaft. Because PRP is autologous, there’s zero risk of rejection—just pure regeneration. We use dual-spin centrifuges for maximum potency and meso-gun delivery for even coverage.",
