    {
      "question": "Does PRP hair treatment hurt?",
      "answer": "Numbing cream plus vibration analgesia make treatments very tolerable. We can add nitrous oxide for anxious patients. Most describe it as mild pressure rather than pain."
    },
    {
      "question": "When will I see new hair growth?",
      "answer": "Initial improvements in hair quality appear within 4-6 weeks. Significant new growth typically becomes visible around 8-12 weeks as follicles regenerate. Peak results at 6 months."
    },
    {
      "question": "Will PRP work for my type of hair loss?",
      "answer": "PRP works best for androgenetic alopecia (male/female pattern thinning), stress-related shedding, and early-stage hair loss where follicles are still active. Complete baldness with non-active follicles is not suitable."
    },
    {
      "question": "Are PRP hair results permanent?",
      "answer": "PRP stimulates natural regrowth which can be long-lasting with proper maintenance. Most patients benefit from booster sessions every 6-9 months to protect and maintain results."
    },
    {
      "question": "How much does PRP hair treatment cost?",
      "answer": "A single session is £450. Our recommended 3-session PRP Starter Series is £1,050 (save £300), which includes LED therapy and supplements. Consultation fee (£75) is credited toward treatment."
    },
    {
      "question": "Is PRP hair treatment safe?",
      "answer": "Yes, PRP is very safe because we use your own blood—zero risk of rejection or allergic reaction. Temporary scalp tenderness or minor bruising may occur. Our clinic is CQC-registered with GMC-certified doctors."
    },
    {
      "question": "Can PRP be combined with other hair treatments?",
      "answer": "Absolutely. We often layer PRP with exosomes, Regenera® micro-grafts, or polynucleotide boosters for accelerated regrowth. Many patients also continue minoxidil or finasteride alongside PRP."
    },
    {
      "question": "How many PRP sessions do I need for hair?",
      "answer": "We recommend 3 initial sessions spaced 4 weeks apart for optimal results. After that, maintenance boosters every 6-9 months help sustain hair density and prevent further thinning."
    }
  ],
  "longDescription": "PRP harnesses the healing power in your own blood. We draw a small sample, concentrate the platelets up to 6x baseline, and inject them across the scalp using ultra-fine needles. Growth factors like PDGF, VEGF, and IGF flood the follicles, boost blood flow, and extend the growth phase. Expect stronger strands, less shedding, and a thicker hairline—without drugs or surgery.",
