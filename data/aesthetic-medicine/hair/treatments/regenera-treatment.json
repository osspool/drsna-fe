{"faq":[{"question":"Will Regenera leave scars?","answer":"Punch sites are only 2-3mm and heal invisibly within a week. They're placed behind the ear in areas covered by hair, so virtually undetectable."},{"answer":"Expect thicker strands and new baby hairs between weeks 6-10, with full density improvement by month 6. Results continue building for up to 12 months.","question":"How soon will I see Regenera results?"},{"question":"How much does Regenera hair treatment cost?","answer":"Regenera Core (single session + PRP booster) is £2,250. Regenera Elite with exosome fusion is £2,850. Consultation fee (£100) is credited toward treatment. 0% finance available."},{"question":"Does Regenera hurt?","answer":"We use local anaesthetic at both the donor site and scalp injection sites. Most patients report mild pressure rather than pain. The procedure is very tolerable."},{"question":"How long do Regenera results last?","answer":"Results typically last 18-24 months. Many patients add quarterly PRP boosters to extend benefits. You can repeat Regenera treatment as needed for ongoing maintenance."},{"question":"Is Regenera better than PRP for hair loss?","answer":"Regenera is more potent than PRP as it delivers actual progenitor cells plus growth factors and matrix proteins. It's ideal when PRP alone hasn't achieved desired results, or for advanced thinning. Many patients combine both for maximum impact."},{"question":"How many Regenera sessions do I need?","answer":"Most patients achieve excellent results with a single Regenera session plus an optional PRP booster at 6 weeks. Unlike PRP which requires multiple sessions, Regenera's potency means one treatment goes a long way."},{"question":"Can I combine Regenera with other hair treatments?","answer":"Yes, Regenera works synergistically with PRP and exosome therapy. Many patients continue using minoxidil or finasteride alongside. Dr Abbas will design your optimal combination protocol."}],"id":"regenera-treatment","whatToExpect":{"enabled":true,"title":"Treatment Journey","background":"gradient-cream","steps":[{"description":"Trichology analysis, donor site selection, and photography.","duration":"20 mins","title":"Consult & Mapping","number":1},{"duration":"15 mins","description":"Local anaesthetic + 2mm punch samples taken discreetly.","number":2,"title":"Micro-Graft Harvest"},{"title":"Processing & Injection","number":3,"duration":"30 mins","description":"Regenera® device creates micro-graft suspension, injected across thinning zones."},{"title":"Booster Plan","number":4,"duration":"5 mins","description":"PRP/exosome add-ons and at-home care schedule."}],"subtitle":"One powerful session, lifetime of impact","variant":"compact-timeline"},"pricing":{"singlePrice":{"currency":"GBP","currentPrice":"£2,250"},"includes":["Consultation & diagnostics","Micro-graft harvest + processing","Targeted injections","Aftercare + follow-up review"],"subtitle":"Consultation fee (£100) credited toward treatment","financing":{"buttonText":"0% finance available","available":true},"packages":[{"price":"£2,250","includes":"LED therapy, supplement kit","description":"Single Regenera® session + PRP booster","name":"Regenera® Core","savings":"Save £250"},{"savings":"Save £420","description":"Regenera® + exosome fusion session","includes":"Home mesotherapy kit","price":"£2,850","name":"Regenera® Elite"}],"title":"Regenera® Pricing"},"hero":{"badge":"One session + 6-week booster","image":"https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1524504388940-b1c1722653e1?w=1920&q=80","headline":"Activate Thinning Zones with Regenera®","subheadline":"Autologous micro-grafts ignite growth where follicles have fallen asleep."},"shortTitle":"Regenera® Hair","description":"Autologous micro-grafts loaded with progenitor cells and growth factors to treat advanced thinning and patchy loss.","bookingInfo":{"duration":"45-minute consultation","consultationFee":"£100 (redeemable)","depositRequired":true,"cancellationPolicy":"72 hours’ notice required"},"seo":{"metaTitle":"Regenera Hair Treatment London | Micro-Graft Hair Regeneration | Dr. SNA Clinic","h1":"Regenera® Hair Treatment in London","keywords":["regenera hair london","micro graft hair treatment","stem cell hair therapy","hair regeneration london"],"canonicalUrl":"/treatments/aesthetic-medicine/hair/regenera-treatment","metaDescription":"Reverse hair thinning with Regenera® micro-graft therapy at Dr. SNA Clinic.

These micro-grafts are immediately processed in the Regenera® medical device, which mechanically breaks down the tissue into a cellular suspension rich in progenitor cells, growth factors, and extracellular matrix. This takes about 10 minutes. We then inject this potent mixture across your thinning areas using fine needles. The entire procedure takes 90 minutes","preparation":"Wash your hair the morning of treatment. Eat a good meal beforehand. Stop blood-thinning supplements for one week. Avoid alcohol 48 hours before. Come with realistic expectations—Regenera works best for diffuse thinning, not complete baldness. Bring a hat to wear home if you prefer. Relax knowing your own cells are doing the heavy lifting","followup":"Tiny punch sites behind your ear heal within 5-7 days and become virtually invisible. Injection sites on scalp may be slightly tender for 24-48 hours. Don't wash hair for 24 hours. Avoid intense exercise, swimming, and saunas for 3 days. No hair coloring or harsh treatments for 2 weeks. Optional PRP booster at 6 weeks enhances results.

Existing thin hairs become thicker and stronger. Hair density measurably improves over 3-6 months. Scalp feels healthier.
