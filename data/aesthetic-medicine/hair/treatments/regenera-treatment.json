  "longDescription": "Regenera® takes a tiny skin sample from the scalp’s strongest follicles, mechanically processes it, and injects the micro-graft suspension into thinning zones. Each graft contains stem-cell-rich tissue, extracellular matrix, and growth factors that trigger dormant follicles, improve density, and nourish the scalp environment. It’s the go-to when you want more potency than PRP but aren’t ready for transplant surgery.",

    "content": "We harvest micro skin samples (2-3mm) behind the ear—an area resistant to loss. Using the Regenera® device, the tissue is mechanically processed into a micro-graft suspension rich in progenitor cells, extracellular matrix, and signaling factors. Injected into thinning areas under local anaesthetic, the solution awakens follicles, thickens miniaturised hairs, and calms inflammation.",
