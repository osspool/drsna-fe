Each injection delivers hydration and anti-inflammatory molecules that soothe your scalp and create the perfect environment for healthy hair growth. The process takes about 20 minutes. You'll feel tiny pinpricks—brief and tolerable—followed by a cooling LED light session that enhances absorption","preparation":"Wash your hair the morning of treatment with gentle shampoo (no styling products). Eat beforehand to keep blood sugar stable. Avoid alcohol and blood-thinning supplements for 3 days prior. Come with realistic expectations—PN is for scalp health and maintenance, not dramatic regrowth alone (combine with PRP or exosomes for that)","followup":"Avoid washing hair for 24 hours to let PN absorb fully. Small bumps at injection sites are normal and fade overnight. No vigorous scalp massage for 3 days. Avoid swimming, saunas, and intense sweating for 48 hours. Use the recommended gentle shampoo and scalp serum. Attend all three sessions (spaced 3-4 weeks apart) for cumulative benefits","outcome":"Scalp feels calmer, less tight, and more comfortable. Itching and flakiness reduce dramatically. Hair shafts appear shinier and healthier. Your scalp becomes the optimal environment for follicles to thrive. Results last 4-6 months.
