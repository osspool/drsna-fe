  "longDescription": "Polynucleotides (PN) are purified DNA fragments that act like a skin reboot button. Once injected, they attract water, awaken fibroblasts, and neutralise inflammation so texture smooths, pores tighten, and your complexion gains that ‘lit-from-within’ radiance. We customise PN protocols for face, neck, chest, and hands—perfect for anyone whose skin looks dull, stressed, or sensitive.",
