  "longDescription": "Skin Range is our concierge skin overhaul. After a diagnostic ‘Skin MOT’ we custom-build a calendar of treatments—think enzyme or TCA peels, microneedling, LED, PN boosters, and at-home actives—all sequenced by Dr. Abbas and our lead medical facialist. The result? Fewer breakouts, tighter pores, calmer pigment, and the confidence that comes from having a plan (and a team) on your side.",
