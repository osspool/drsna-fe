{"longDescription":"Skin Range is our concierge skin overhaul. After a diagnostic ‘Skin MOT’ we custom-build a calendar of treatments—think enzyme or TCA peels, microneedling, LED, PN boosters, and at-home actives—all sequenced by Dr. Abbas and our lead medical facialist. The result? Fewer breakouts, tighter pores, calmer pigment, and the confidence that comes from having a plan (and a team) on your side.","categoryId":"aesthetic-medicine","tagline":"Curated Skin Journeys for Real-World Glow","title":"Signature Skin Range Programme","quickStats":{"sessions":"6–8 curated sessions","duration":"45–60 mins per visit","price":"Programmes from £950","painLevel":"Low–Moderate (customised)","downtime":"0–3 days depending on peel depth","resultsVisible":"Progressive over 4–8 weeks","resultsLast":"Maintain with quarterly boosts","anesthesia":"Topical numbing when needed"},"overview":{"highlights":["Personal skin concierge + doctor oversight","Homecare bag curated to your skin goals","Progress photography + hydration metrics","SOS access to our skin team for flare-ups"],"content":"No two programmes look the same.
